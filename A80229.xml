            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E conſulting about (not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our retired thoughts, but openly) the ſtructure of the <hi>Temple of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> to the honour of God Almighty, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe of mankinde, and <hi>Praeludium</hi> of the life to come, it's meet we imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the skill of wiſe Architects, who uſe not to attempt the rearing of any great worke without a foregoing delineation thereof. Which thing, beſides the delight, (for the minde, ſince 'tis na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally carried out to the future, is much taken with the foreſight of what is likely to enſue) is of notable uſe for the ſaving the loſſe of charges, time, and credit. For having erected the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion or Idea of a future worke, we may readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive whether the fulneſſe of the whole, the Symmetry of the parts, and the comelineſſe in each regard ſufficiently agree. And then if any thing ſhall be obſerved to be defective, or redundant, otherwiſe then may be thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, we have liberty to adde, take away, and alter, in reference to neceſſity or our owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. An exacter account likewiſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
<pb facs="tcp:169741:6"/> may be collected, while out of ſuch a plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the length, bredth, and height, with the matter, forme, worke-men, inſtruments, and time thereto requiſite are foreſeen: which things compared with his abilities, the Architect Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges whether or no the worke may be ſafely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke.

            <p>Now Architects are wont in a threefold way to conceive and ſet out in a Patterne the forme of a future worke, <hi>In plano,</hi> or upon a flat, or levell, as in laying the foundations; <hi>in fronte,</hi> or to outward view, as ſhall be ſeene in ſetting up the walls; laſt of all moſt fully, as all things ſhall cohere among themſelves within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, according to their ſeverall dimenſions.

                  <head>THE ICHNOGRAPHY OF THE TEMPLE of WISEDOME, Compriſed in APHORISMES.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E Stile the TEMPLE of WISEDOME a Book in which to man, as a Creature, made to view the workes of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, all things which are, ſhall be, or have been any where, are offered for his Contemplation, to that end, and in that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by the means diſpoſed to the end, as by the helpe of them all, he may be led, and brought on to him, of whom, through whom, and to whom, are all things, God, and to that eternall happineſſe which is in him.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. For this is to be wiſe at length, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and provide for our latter end (as God ſpeaks, Deut. 32.29.) leaſt a man ſwerve from his ſcope, happineſſe, to the enjoyment of which with his Maker he was created: even as that deſire which is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:169741:8"/> naturall to him diſcovers, whereby every man wiſhes well to himſelfe, and that perpetually. For he abhors death and ruine, and courts to lead a moſt pleaſant life, and hence he declines all kind of evill and adverſity.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. But ſince men have ſo bruitiſhly degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, by their heynous falling into ſinne, continued for many ages, and alwaies increaſed that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apprehend, nor care to underſtand Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in their Creation, nor thoſe deſires implanted in them naturally, much leſſe the wayes poynting to an happy life; they are to bee rouſed up out of their drowſineſſe by all meanes and devices poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. In as much as wee all ſtand obliged to bee diſpenſers of divine goodneſſe, and to be deſirous to impart ſo much light to others as wee have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God our ſelves. To the end that through the multiplication and different mutuall reflection, repercuſſion, and mixture of raies, light may come to an increaſe in their mindes, to ſee and finde out the Father of lights, and to walke in his light.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Now although God himſelfe by his owne vertue, upholds the World which he hath created, beautifies it with his light, and governes it by his providence: yet becauſe what hee doth ordinarily, he doth by ordinary meanes, it comes to paſſe that one creature by another is formed, reformed, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169741:8"/> and directed to their ends through his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Wee may bring for a witneſſe the whole Quire of Creatures, and all the workes of Nature joind in ſo cloſe an order amongſt themſelves, that none of them hath a being, or is made from it ſelfe, for it ſelfe, or by it ſelfe; but every thing depends of another, ſerves another, and is ſuſtained by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Whence indeed it is, that he hath diſtributed ſeverall vertues to ſeverall creatures, that each (on that part by which it is what it is, and doth what it doth) imitating the courſe of its Creator, is ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to its neighbour creatures, and ſo tends to the preſervation of the univerſe.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Wherefore ſince God likewiſe in mankind for the graduall multiplying of the light of his knowledge, and of his works, hath hitherto impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved one by the help of another; and now the laſt age of the world ſeemes to be upon us, we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think our ſelves how we alſo may proceed (which verily may be hoped for in this life) to the utmoſt degree of knowledge; to wit, that we render our knowledge. 1. Univerſall, diſgraced with no foul Caſme. 2. Altogether true, ſpoyled with no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of falſehood and vanity. 3. Moſt eaſie, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with no troubleſome obſcurities and thorny doubts; but flowing fairely into the minde of its own accord.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Which three if we may come to obtain,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169741:9"/> our humane knowledge wil be in ſome ſort perfect, <hi>viz</hi> the image of divine omniſcience clearly ſhining in us: ſo diſpoſing us, that ſtriving in the ſame waies, by the ſame meanes, to the ſame ends, we may lay aſide our uſuall diſcords, and the vanities of all idle imployments, all of us being onely ready to reliſh, act, and ſpeake the beſt things.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. We determine therefore, that a Booke ſhould be compiled, for the containing all things which are neceſſary to be knowne and done, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and hoped for by man, in reſpect of this and the life to come, <hi>viz.</hi> an entire narration of thoſe things which we know already, with an exact In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex of ſuch things as we are ignorant of, whether they be thoſe whoſe knowledge is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attainable, or thoſe that are left for further ſearch. And all theſe things to that end, and in that order, that the mindes of men by <hi>medium's</hi> may be (as it were by a kind of an artificiall Ladder) advanced from the firſt to the laſt, the loweſt to the higheſt, even to him from whom, by whom, and for whom are all things.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. But that the ſame Booke may teach the ſame thing truely, and demonſtrate it ſolidly, that it may throughly appeare, that they are not the trifles of fancies, but the firme foundations of things themſelves: and that we may know that we are indued with knowledge, and not opinion. This Booke then ſhall containe nothing which may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169741:9"/> be diſpleaſing to our aſſent (as things apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe or vaine, or not prov'd or improbable are) or may not only tickle and invite our aſſent (as things which are likely and probable,) but compell it, which force remaines in the unvanquiſhed and ever victorious truth, ſo that it be but skillfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaind, and laid forth to open view.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. Moreover, it is neceſſary this Booke ſhould be contrived in a method, exactly fitted to diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that whoſoever ſhall read it, may likewiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it; carried on with a cleare and full light throughout, to the end that being tranſlated into the common tongues of ſeverall nations, it may be made of as common uſe, as God himſelfe, the world, and our common ſenſe is: ſo as it may be nothing elſe but the true and genuine Copy of thoſe things which hither to the onely God hath revealed by his workes, his word, and notions imprinted in the minde of every man; and the true and common luminary and guide of us all to the life to come; and the Rule, and true directory of all things that are to be done in this life.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. The matter, Forme, Efficient, and end of it may move and perſwade, that this ſame Booke ſhould be termed PANSOPHY.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. For the matter of it ſhall bee <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which is to ſay, the Univerſe, and that whereof a wiſe man ought not to bee ignorant; namely, whatſoever good, gallant, and profitable thing,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169741:10"/> is any where to be found in Bookes; or what things likewiſe are not yet extant in any place, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe are in poſſibility to be had (things newly diſcovered, or what may be invented) we would have to be conveyed hither, that what thing ſoever ſhall come to be mentioned or thought upon, a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient information thereof may be here extant.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. The forme of this Booke ought to bee <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that is, an Univerſall harmony, or a conſonance and agreement of each thing to other. For obſervations delivered here and there concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning things, although they be profitable, ſhall not be amaſſed and throwne upon an heape here; but the inmoſt nature of thoſe very things is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected with that artifice, that as there is no diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in God the Authour of things, nor in his workes and words, ſo there may be left no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in our apprehenſions: the <hi>medium</hi>'s, <hi>viz</hi> the Centers of this being found out, in which alſo the extreames and oppoſites may agree, and ceaſe their jarring, whereby there's hope it may be brought to paſſe, that whatſoever diverſe men (ſo it be with reaſon) diverſly think or act, either not knowing, or not underſtanding, or even oppoſing themſelves, mutually may here come into a conſent and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: all the rivulets of thoughts and actions being reduced to their true and pure fountaines, where, will they nill they, they may acknowledge that they do agree, the rivulets, windings, and filthineſſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169741:10"/> which runs mixt therewith being now left out. For it will fall out that the moſt contradictions and controverſies may be decided by neither or both. In that way that Chriſt determin'd the variance of the Jewes and Samaritans contending about the place of prayer ſaying, Neither in this mountaine, nor at Jeruſalem, but every where in ſpirit and truth. And in another place, do this, and leave not the other undone, Mat. 23.13.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. The Efficient being of ſuch fulneſſe and harmony, can be no other than <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, an univerſallity of the principles of knowing, <hi>viz.</hi> that what helps ſoever are divinely adminiſtred to man for to encreaſe and rectifie the light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, all thoſe ſhould be here whole, and entire; namely, upon Gods part revealing himſelfe to us, without himſelfe thoſe Theaters in which he hath unfolded what he had a will to, <hi>viz.</hi> the World, with all the workemanſhip of nature; and our minde, with all notions written thereupon; and the holy Scriptures, with all thoſe myſteries which are here diſplayd. And on our part, all thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments granted us to apprehend thoſe things which God hath revealed, <hi>viz.</hi> The outward and inward ſenſes, and the ſound faculty of reaſoning, or diſcourſe; and laſtly, Faith, which is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to divine Oracles. For all theſe things, if they be fully employed, will cauſe us know all things which may be knowne: for becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169741:11"/> can be knowne, but what's revealed, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by Senſe, or Reaſon, or Faith, or by all theſe joyntly: why may not he who knows theſe things, be ſaid to know all things?</p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. The end of the Booke ſhall be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>viz.</hi> the univerſall uſe of all things unto all things, that whatſoever man muſt do or ſuffer, in time and eternity, may be learnt here at once: and that the minde of man may be here compos'd to a ſufficient knowledge of all things: and the hands, and other members for the profitable contrivance of ſeverall good workes, and the tongue for the apt utterance of each meaning of the minde; and the affections to the embracing of things of worth, and the avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſuch as are uſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="17">XVII. Concerning the making of ſuch a Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophicall Booke, that our thoughts may be ſeriouſly taken up; the very order of divine providence doth now lead us thither, the neceſſities of mankind compell us, and the preſent occaſions invite us. The explaining of which three ſhall ſerve for the laying the foundation of our Panſophicall Temple.</p>
                  <p n="18">XVIII. God as he is wiſe doth all things or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, every thing in its time, as the wiſe Solomon ſpeaketh; and as he is good performes all well.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169741:11"/> Therefore this is the proceſſe of good, rightly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, that it may increaſe by motion, proceeding from good to better, from the leſſe to the greater, till the arrivall be at that, then which there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing greater and better, that is to ſay, Perfection: which progreſſe of Gods wiſedome, all the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his workes teſtifie.</p>
                  <p n="19">XIX. So although he could have fram'd the world in one moment, yet he was pleas'd to make uſe of a tract of time, and a graduall ſucceſſion of formes, imprinting themſelves upon their matter; beginning his workes from unſhap'd, confus'd, and darke rudiments, yet ending in moſt diſtinct, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, and excellent formes: which Law likewiſe he hath ſtampt upon nature her ſelfe, ſo that what things ſoever be produced, ariſe out of their ſeeds ſlender, and imperfect, and take their augmentation by little and little, even till they arrive in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall kindes at their determinate accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="20">XX. He hath put mankinde in all things under the ſame condition. For when he could have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it in the full number (as the Angels and ſtars) as many as he pleas'd, he created the ſtock, onely, man and woman, and with the granting to theſe the multiplying their kinde, allotted for the generation of men ſome thouſand yeares, till the whole earth might be filled with Inhabitants.</p>
                  <p n="21">XXI. And when as he could have diſclos'd to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169741:12"/> theſe men at one and the ſame time, the ſecrets of all myſteries in things naturall, artificiall, morrall, and divine; he choſe rather to uſe an accuſtomed gradation, and leaſureably to encreaſe the light of Sciences, Arts, and Faith, as all things to this very day hold on in their progreſſe.</p>
                  <p n="22">XXII. For the age of all mankind, is as it were the age of one man, admitting its increaſe by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and promoting it ſelfe from Infancy by youth to a ripe and well ſettled ſtrength of minde. which AUGUSTINE obſerving writes thus: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence by a faire moderation of all things, ſo diſpoſes the whole Series of generations from ADAM to the end of the world, as it were of one man, terminating the tract of his time in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of age, even from childhood to a decrepid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. And hence there are alſo degrees of vertue in manners, till he come to the cleare and perfect ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of man, it concernes him to diſtinguiſh who piouſly devotes his minde to divine reading. (Of his 83. Queſt. the 53.)</p>
                  <p n="23">XXIII. And that it is ſo, that all things encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with mankinde, Sciences, Arts, Vertues, and Vices, Faith and Treachery, that is, impiety and errours; and by the occaſion of Errours that new torches are lighted againe for the better illuſtration of truth: he perceives who ſees any thing in Sacred or prophane Hiſtory. For all things came forth as it were out of darkeneſſe into light, one thing after
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169741:12"/> another: and every thing was in his firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings rude and unpoliſht, receiving by little and little diſtincter formes, and true perfection: And laſtly, every invention paſſed from his inventor to other men, and people one after another, by ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive imitation.</p>
                  <p n="24">XXIV. What therefore ſhould keep us from hoping that it may fall out at length, that thoſe things which had their encreaſe by parts, may grow up into the whole, and that thoſe things which we poliſht by degrees, may at length be extant in a perfect forme. And what things formerly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to this or that man, or Nation, tongue and Sect may become common unto mankinde. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely that which hath a graduall aſcent, muſt needs have a top: And if CICERO ſaid truely; Time extinguiſhes the fopperies of opinions: (And why not? whereas truth the daughter of time, is onely ſolid, the fumes of opinions cannot but be ſubject to diſperſions:) why do we not hope that the fictions and errours of ſo many Ages, may even through tract of time, at length be diſcovered, and expung'd?</p>
                  <p n="25">XXV. Now if we may well hope for ſuch a thing, why may we not likewiſe deſire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it? For what will that bee but a declaring of our ſelves Adminiſtrers of divine bounty, which uſes to communicate it ſelfe by degrees, and diffuſe it ſelfe more and more continually?</p>
                  <p n="26">
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:169741:13"/>XXVI. Therefore, if we ſhall now at length aſſay to collect into one body, that various and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold light appearing at firſt as ſparkes, afterward as torches, which the Father of lights in the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of fore-paſt ages kindled, and hath dayly more and more encreaſed. And then after we have redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it into one univerſall Maſſe, endeavour to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it moſt cleare and pure, and produce it for the worlds publick uſe and benefit, we may aſſure our ſelves we do nothing but what divine providence hath even led us by the hand to effect.</p>
                  <p n="27">XXVII. Yea to do this ſame, the very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of mankind urge and compell us, which I ſhall explaine briefly, firſt of all in generall; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by certain ranks or orders of men; at length by carrying a reſpect to theſe our owne times into which we are now come.</p>
                  <p n="28">XXVIII. Touching the perpetuall confuſions of humane affairs: the complaints of wiſe men in every age are ſufficiently knowne and manifeſt, ſo as none can be ignorant thereof, unleſſe he be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſtranger in the world, ſuch as Infants newly entred into it are, or a meer trunck or block, as foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ones are, who mind not what goes forward, nor regard or care how it's done. Now theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions ſpring and ariſe hence, in as much as the greater ſort of men (who even in their own and the worlds account ſeem to be wiſe) do all, or at leaſt their principall and chiefe buſineſſes without
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169741:13"/> Counſell or reaſon, raſhly, and ignorantly: In which ſenſe, AUGUSTINE call'd the moſt men fooles, (<hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de lib. art. cap.</hi> 9.) And agreeable to this ſaith CICERO, there's nothing ſo common and ordinary as to underſtand nothing alſo: I think the Mule breeds oftner than a wiſe man is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Since wiſedome therefore the Governeſſe of things, deſerts men; what wonder need it be to us to ſee all things done immoderately, and by way of tumult, and our imployments to miſſe of their ends, by running out of their bounds and limits, and our ſelves thruſt headlong into ſundry precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. It muſt neceſſarily redound then to the health and welfare of mankind, to place ſo clearly in the ſight and view of all men, the true diſcover'd ends of things, and their certain <hi>medium</hi>'s leading to thoſe ends, and all the orderly and due manners, Courſes and wayes of ſuch <hi>medium</hi>'s, that all men may in ſeeing ſee, and being taken with the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that true happineſſe, (which only true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhews, and gives a fore-taſte of) be inflamed with the vehement and ardent love thereof. And this is that very thing which PANSOPHY ſeeks after and hopes for, through its waies of full Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality, Truth, and Facility.</p>
                  <p n="29">XXIX. For becauſe thoſe things are many, and after a ſort infinite, which men in this life have for their Objects; as well without themſelves, things naturall and artificiall, morrall and ſpirituall, good
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169741:14"/> and bad; as within themſelves, inclinations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, various affections, and laſtly, near adjoyning to themſelves, other mens opinions, ſtudyes, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and very different actions; it cannot be but they muſt be ſeverally diſtracted and confounded by all theſe, ſo as they cannot do that which ought chiefly and eſpecially to be performed; but even as any one by meer hap falls this way, or that way, ſo he permits himſelfe to be inwrapp'd, and intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled. Whence it comes to paſſe, that whereas God made man right, they immix themſelves both with infinite queſtions and occupations, (Eccleſ. 7.30.) and according to that complaint of SENECA'S, like a company of Cattell, they follow the flock a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not going where they ſhould, but where they behold others. For which Ataxy or irregularity, no other remedy can be found, than that all things which a man either doth or may meet with, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, into a fixed and ſettled order, the Weights and valuations of all things, being evidently extant, that every one for his own benefit may clearly ſee, and wholely underſtand, what ought, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe-full, afore or after, more or leſſe, to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, affected, brought about and diſpatched; which cannot be without an univerſall fore-knowledge and ſurvey of things. For all things that are be ſo inter-woven by divine Artifice, (which PANSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHY will manifeſt and make cleare) that every thing is not ſo much for its own ſake as for others:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:169741:14"/> whence tis, that all things mutually cohere and become ſerviceable, and by turnes, not only things alike, but what are diverſe and even contraries, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate and ſet out themſelves: as we have it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in the body of any creature, how all the members, the greateſt and leaſt, higheſt and loweſt, firſt and laſt, ſerve one another mutually: ſo that if you take away one, you ſhall ſpoyle and maime the uſe of the whole. Seeing therefore all things that are come to the compoſition and framing of the whole Univerſe, as of one Common-wealth by a concatination, or chaining together, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where broke or interrupted, it muſt needs happen that by the ignorance of one remarkable thing, the truth of many be likewiſe darkned and obſcured. Certainly, as SENECA ſaid of the Writings of great and noted men: They are wholely to be look'd into, wholely to be handled and peruſed; For by the lineaments of their wit, they knit a worke, from whence nothing can be withdrawne, without a marring and ruinous defacement of the reſt. That may be far oftner ſpoken of the whole ſtructure of things and learning, that nothing can be withdrawne thence without ſpoile and ruine. Which alſo the ſame Authour ſaies in another place concerning the Counſel of life, and the aberrations of Counſels: we therefore offend, or ſwerve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we all deliberate to change the parts of life, but none of us conſult about the whole. It agrees
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:169741:15"/> and ſquares moſt aptly with the ſearch and enquiry of truth: therefore we erre diverſly, becauſe we deliberate about the parts and parcels of truth, but no man makes any matter, or troubles himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the whole entire Univerſall Catholick truth, uniting and kniting it ſelfe together on every ſide: which alſo FRANCISCUS SANCHEZ ſaw, and thus expreſſed: <hi>Libro quod nihil ſcitur,</hi> pag. 47. There's ſuch a Concatination in all things, as no one may be idle but hinder or further another; yea, every one is deſigned for this hurting or helping of very many. Therfore for the perfect knowledge of every thing, tis requiſite we know all things: And a little after you ſhall underſtand this by the familiar example of an ordinary Clocke. For if you would know how it ſtrikes hourely, its meet you looke round all the wheeles from the firſt to the laſt, and what moves the firſt, and how this another, and that others, even to the laſt, &amp;c. We muſt imagine the ſame in the great Orbe of things, in which you can find nothing but moves and is moved, changes and is changed, acts, and ſuffers. PANSOPHY therefore by whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Counſel takes all things in generall into its conſideration, that it may evidently and moſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare, how leſſer things are, and come to be ſubordinate to the greater, the greater to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, the former to the latter, and the latter to the laſt; infinite things to finite, and the finite to one:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169741:15"/> that is, all viſible things to man, temporall things to eternity, and things created to their Creator; and that nothing of all be omitted or left out, which may not be conſtrained and compelled to ſerve our laſt or ultimate end.

Now there ought to be no leſſe, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greater care and ſolicitude about truth then univerſality: For to know truth is divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſaith LACTANTIUS: Nor is there any uſe at all of figments but to mock and abuſe wits, and lead men aſide into wayleſſe places: Therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the moſt thoughts of mortals are miſty or ſmoky, ſlippery, crooked, vaine, and unprofitable for workes or actions, becauſe for the moſt part inſtead of things which are true we acquieſſe and reſt in things which are like to, counterfeit or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble truth, embrace opinions for verity, and running out into opinions we have and returne lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of certaine knowledge. Whence it is, that we had better be ignorant, then poſſeſſed with the knowledge of what is bad; becauſe ignorance is leſſe hurtfull then errour; even as a neutrality or indifferency in health is more tolerable, and rather to be endured then a ſickly and diſtempered condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as a rude behaviour or ruſtick carriage is to be preferred before manerlineſſe and civility
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:169741:16"/> trimmed and poliſhed for ſlineſſe and malice. In as much then as there are to be ſought out by us (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we will be deceived and become vaine) not things which are true and good to ſhew, but ſolid and ſubſtantiall, which may render us truely wiſe, good and happy: O how is it then to be wiſhed that we had certaine and infallible rules of truth and goodneſſe! For though our knowledge is like to be more contracted, and fall within a narrower compaſſe if we onely follow and purſue things which are certaine: Yet even that very little of dyed and approved truth, and that which affords ſure and infallible uſe ſhall be of more account and eſteeme then all weake opinions or gueſſes how diffuſed and large ſoever, or then any vaine and idle delights of fancy: Becauſe its infinitely better to know any thing then to conjecture at infinite. And to the ſick patient one little potion which eaſes him of his malady, is better then infinite moſt ſubtle diſcourſes touching his ſickneſſe, or what remedies ſoever by the greateſt proviſion and care procured and tendered to him, but not expelling or remove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſickneſſe from the place where it chiefely lies. For AUGUSTINE ſayes well; truth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it be is better then all that which may be deviſed and feigned according to our pleaſure. (<hi>Lib. de Ver. Relig. cap.</hi> 5.) Since therefore the wiſer ſort of men acknowledge, and confeſſe, and bewaile, and deplore the mixture of errours with
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:169741:16"/> truth in Phyloſophy and Divinity, and up and downe elſe where: PANSOPHY which ſerves and ſeekes to collect onely things irrefragably true, and in a manner apodictically to demonſtrate how to poſſeſſe them ſecurely; endeavours without doubt a buſineſſe which is likely to be very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and advantagious to mankinde: For what I pray is the reaſon why we ſhould be willing to be cheated and mockt perpetually with uncertaine things, however plauſibly made and contrived? Opinions <hi>ad placitum,</hi> or meerly to our owne like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are as HELIOGABALUS his banquets, who delighted his gueſts with painted viands, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diſmiſſed them hungry. That Feaſt is the beſt ordered where the gueſts are entertained with wholeſome and well relliſhed diſhes, although but few: Not where the pallat is provoked and enſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with various and contrary meates. For there good concoction, good ſleepe, good digeſtion, a good colour in the face, and a good habitude of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and minde follows and attends a moderate plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Here ſurfeits, difficult repoſe, doting dreams, vomits, or wringings of the belly, diſeaſes and deaths enſue. And as that is not a good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable pourtracture of a man which is fairely drawne; but that which extactly and exquiſitely reſembles his lively lookes featured whatſoever it be; ſo not that Geographicall table deſerves praiſe which is garniſhed and ſet out with colours and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169741:17"/> (ſuch as affect and take children) but that which exhibits the true and genuine diſtances of places: even ſo directly that book ſhall be held, and judg'd the beſt, that feigning or painting nothing <hi>ad placi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> repeſents all things in that manner and forme, which the things in themſelves are.

But indeed, there will be need alſo of the light of method, by which only there is hope it may be obtain'd; that all things truly delivered may be both pleaſantly read and eaſily underſtood, and hereby this book may become a wholſome lure of wits, and a Ladder happily erected, to climb and mount by to the tops of things: and laſtly, an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catious remedy to take away in the greater part the differences of the world.

It's in vaine to hope that humane things, prolapſed and falne to decay by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon errours of all can be reſtored and made entire, without the common help and joynt aſſiſtance of all: For ſeeing all are members of the worlds Common-wealth; no ſooner can the ſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſociety be amended and chang'd for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then all begin to act by reaſon whatſoever they do, as well thoſe that are ſubject and inferiours, as

                  <p n="34">XXXIV. It's evident, that differences, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, and brawles do ſtill reigne every where, and trouble the affaires of men: Nor is it unknown to the wiſer ſort that theſe contradictions and quarrels come from divers and contrary ſtudies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we learne not wiſely to relliſh, act, and ſpeak the ſame things; but we whiſper ſeverall things into one another, or we are carried hither and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, every one by his proper eagerneſſe and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: If therefore it may be obtained or brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, that all men as they are made by one God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his image, deſtinated to one end of bleſſed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with him; ſent into the ſame ſchoole of this preſent life; furniſhed with the ſame requiſites of neceſſary helpes, or are certainely apt to be furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; ſo may they but ſuffer themſelves to be led by the hand in common from a common principle, through common meanes to common ends; why may we not hope more ſerious ſtudy about ſerious things, and leſſe ſtir about trifles and by this more concord and leſſe difference? Now ſince PANSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHY wiſhes, ſeekes, and aſſaies this it verily wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, ſeekes and aſſaies a buſineſſe likely to beſtead and profit man-kind in common.</p>
                  <p n="35">XXXV. But let us come to particulars, and give a briefe touch by the way what hope PANSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHY
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169741:19"/> may afford of bettering the ſtate as well of the Vulgar as the Learned, and the Civill and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, and to conclude all the Nations of the whole world.</p>
                  <p n="36">XXXVI. Theres none but ſees in what things the vulgar ſort of men buſie themſelves; namely, in things frivolous and vaine, or truely in externalls which onely extend themſelves to this fugitive and tranſient life, they regard not ſollider good things internall and eternall, becauſe they know them not; now they know them not, becauſe they are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted therewith; therefore they delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with gugawes, bawbles and trifles of their owne. For what can he doe who hath not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the inward culture and adorning of the ſoule? Who hath not taſted the ſweeter fruits of vertues? Who hath not lookt into the more precious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Wiſdome? Who is in no meaſure admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſecrets of Heaven and Earth? How can ſuch an one imploy himſelfe ſave in ſweating and toyling to plow the earth, gather fruits, ſcrape up mony, and to ſearch and looke into ſuch things as are done in neighbouring houſes and places adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? For it is not granted to humane nature to be altogether idle and drowſie, it will be buſied, or buſie it ſelfe. He that doth not this muſt needes doe ſomething elſe; and he who transfers not the forcible bent and inclination of his nature to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matters, falls certainely into ſuch as are worſe:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169741:19"/> It will be therefore a wholeſome intent and good purpoſe that even the very common people be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited at length into the common amphitheater of Gods wiſdome, and that the vaile being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne from theſe things in the preſence of all, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine treaſures be repreſented as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and come to be eſteemed of from the truth and reallity of the matter, to the end that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of better and truer good things being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, they may accuſtome themſelves to eſteeme leſſe of tranſitory worldly allurements, and make ſmaller reckoning of ſhaddowes then ſubſtances; and finally, alſo that thoſe men of the loweſt ranke, condemned to labours and grievous troubles, may by the hope of better things eaſe their calamitous and wretched condition.</p>
                  <p n="37">XXXVII. Touching the ſtate of learned men, PANSOPHY rightly conſtituted, may ſundry wayes availe and advantage them.</p>
                  <p n="38">XXXVIII. For firſt of all 'tis certaine, that very few of thoſe who either pleaſe themſelves with the name of learning, or are admired by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, rely either on their owne, or on the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things. For they follow the opinions of one another, which ſince they vanouſly depart from themſelves and from things, it comes to paſſe that there is no end of doubts, contradictions, and diſputes in Church and Schoole; by which the wits of the learned, and the conſciences of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:169741:20"/> are troubled and tortured without end: For which diſeaſe if a meet remedy be ſought out, it cannot be any other then that all be taught to follow, not the leaden rule of this and that Doctor, but the adamantine rule of God and things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and heereby not to come to bare ſuppoſalls but knowledge; which Will be done not by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the externall likelihood of things, or acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcing therein, but by ſearching by certaine wayes the very intimate, ſolid, and unmoved truth of things, and by placing it in open view after it is drawne forth and ſolidly demonſtrated, which thing PANSOPHY ſeekes after.</p>
                  <p n="39">XXXIX. Furthermore, if we look upon thoſe that ſtudy Arts &amp; Sciences, ſome well obſerve that that variety of methods (by which every Science &amp; Art, &amp; Tongue, otherwiſe then as it differs; yea, the very ſame is delivered by one Authour on this maner by another on that) is not onely a <hi>Remora,</hi> but even a vexation and torment to wits: For hence it comes to paſſe, that all indeed make but difficult progreſſe; and the moſt taking a nauſeous diſtaſt, and deterred with ſo many new lets and croſſes continually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſtart back from the courſe of their ſtudies to other kindes of life, or wearied in ſo rugged a path, ſlake in their alacrity, leaving many things either untouched, or touching them but in an overly and ſuperficiall manner. Truely HERCULEAN wits are rarely and ſeldome knowne into whoſe breſts
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169741:20"/> new valour returnes, and a new vigour ariſes at the meeting of a new monſter, and the approach of a new encounter: And therefore ſolid Scholars grow ſo rare; who then may not thinke it profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and neceſſary that this bar be removed? For thoſe of BAZIL write wel in their <hi>Diatriba,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the compendious manner of learning, the Hebrew and Chalde tongue annexed to <hi>Mercurius Quadrilinguis,</hi> Printed in the Yeare, 1637. It cannot be well declared what a compendium or ſaving of labour and weariſomeneſſe it may be, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where to uſe the ſame Authour, the ſame Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and the ſame Method. Now PANSOPHY ſhall be no other then ſuch a compendium of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things in one perpetuall Method.</p>
                  <p n="40">XL. And becauſe ſuch are not a wanting, who burning with the love of Sciences and Wiſdome, yet by reaſon of the affaires and imployments of life, with which they are diſtracted, cannot be at leaſure for the ſearching through of Libraries: Its altogether needfull that theſe have ſome briefe, but withall ſtrong <hi>Viaticum</hi> of Learning, by vertue whereof, as ELIAS refreſht by the ſervice of an Angell with a morſell of bread, and draught of water, went on through Deſerts to the Mount of God; ſo they alſo may be able to preſerve ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life in any noyſe and hurry of buſineſſes. Now indeed of this nature is that which PANSOPHY endeavours; by which both men being at leaſure
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169741:21"/> may be profitably employed, and being employed may be ſpeedily promoted to their principall ends and aimes. For it ſhall teach us to attend, and doe the firſt things firſtly, and the chiefer chiefely; with the certaine uſe alſo of thoſe things to good ends, which buſie others without uſe or benefit at all.</p>
                  <p n="41">XLI. Againe, thoſe who ſaile through the vaſt ſeas of Authors, they have need as well as thoſe that float in the Wilderneſſe of the Ocean of ſome ſuch magnetick directory, whereby they may the better keepe and maintaine themſelves from errours, quick-ſands, and rocks. For thoſe who ſailed by ſea, before the uſe of the Loadſtone was invented, could not know whither they might be carried, and what way to ſteere the ſhip, unleſſe it were in a cleare sky, or in view of ſhoare; in darke and cloudy weather, and when they were carried forth into the deepe they were at a loſſe, and at their wits end: So they who enter into the ſea of Authours furniſhed with no rules beſides the common and cloudable Sunne of common knowledges, and the ſhoares of preconceived doctrines, cannot but be in all places uncertaine and doubtfull of the event: Therefore ſince PANSOPHY endeavours to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute ſuch an univerſall directory (to wit an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall and perpetuall harmony of truth) which who hath ready at hand, neede not care for any depths, nights, and darkneſſe, being certaine of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169741:21"/> poles or hinges of the world, and ſecure of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Port to which he tends; why may we not believe that it endeavours a buſineſſe profitable and neceſſary for learned men in common?</p>
                  <p n="42">XLII. If we have regard to Philoſophers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part (who being intent upon the ſpeculation of all things, and their cauſes wherein they are contained, ought to be Maſters of all things which are done rationably in any place) we ſhall finde that their ſtate eſpecially ſtands in neede of bettering and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment. For what Philoſophy ſoever the Schooles have and peremptorily hold, even all that is drawne from the Greekes and Arabians (Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Mahumetans:) and therefore however it be freed from mixed ſuperſtitions, is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe very imperfect. Of which thing there are three certaine documents or ſure proofes: Firſt, becauſe theſe being not furniſht with Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, (by which they might correct the aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of their ſenſes and reaſon) could not but be blinded and deceived in all chiefe and principall matters: For they were ignorant of the beginning of the World, as alſo of its end, and knew neither the conſtitution nor corruption of mans nature, nor its amendment, and manner of its amendment: Therefore what ſound thing could they deliver ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of nature or morality? Furthermore, that Greekiſh Philoſophy was then when it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and ſet up (namely, in the time of SOCRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TES,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169741:22"/> PLATO, ARISTOTLE) a meere new thing in the world, deſtitute of ſufficient experiences, catching at and laying hold upon any thing in its way, from this perſon thus, from another other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and all things were transferred to matter of profeſſion and diſputes, in which ſome have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapped others and doe hitherto enwrap their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, with drawing wits from things to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their owne conceptions; and as it were enſnaring them in jives and fetters, ſo as they cannot freely contemplate things. Laſtly, even the matter it ſelfe inſtructs us, that the true and living Roots have been and ſtill are a wanting to this Heatheniſh Phyloſophy, by which it being vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and quickned, might have growne continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into a larger tree, and have produced alwayes more copious and abundant fruits. For that it ought to have been ſo, we ſee it in the example of Mechanick Arts, which as it were endued with a vitall ſpirit, encreaſe dayly, and come to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: That if their firſt Inventers were alive againe, they ſhould have need to turne Apprentices, and be ſet to learne, ſo rude were their firſt endeavours in compariſon of this perfection, to which by the labour and diligence of their ſucceſſors they are at this time advanced. Now we ſee the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Philoſophicall Sciences, that they throve moſt of all in their firſt Authours, and afterwards languiſht; ſo that Moderne Perſons may thinke
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169741:22"/>
'tis enough for them even a far off to follow their foot-ſteps, which they openly confeſſe, who with ſuch prayſes extoll ARISTOTLE the Authour of this Philoſophy, as they aſſigne to him the Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip, Empire, and Tribunall of Wiſdome, not daring at any time to go out of his track or foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Hence it comes to paſſe that the Sciences for ſo many Ages ſtick faſt in the footſteps of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, nor receive ſuch increaſe as may beſeeme mankinde, and grow adored after the maner of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, but finde not any promotion or advancement: For if in the meane while any new thing be found out (as are the knowledge of the Load-ſtone, the Algebra, Logarithmes, Canons about Creeks and Gulfes, Clocks or Watches, the Art of Printing Bookes, &amp;c.) this truely is not found out by the guidance and helpe of that Ancient Philoſophy; but either by chance, or for that more excellent and choyce wits piercing further made bold to aſſay ſomething peculiar, I wiſh to God then we might prevaile with thoſe who devote themſelves to the contemplation of things, that the principles being only rightly ordained, that they would give their mindes to trace the hidden truth of things, in things not in bookes or the conceits of others: O what faire and great hopes ſhew themſelves of having continually more plentifull treaſures of the wiſdome of God digged forth? which as yet are, and will lye hid if men perſevere in the reſting on
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:169741:23"/> things found out, and adhere onely to the cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and deviſes of others. For what novelty I pray you can he finde out, who keepes himſelfe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the wayes where an infinite go by perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? What gold can he get out who ties and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaves himſelfe to a veine already exhauſted by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers even to the leaſt parcell or crum, or that tries mettally earth over againe, which hath been a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times refined in hope of drawing ſomething out of it ſtill? It concernes therefore Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers that leaving theſe emptyed Mines, they open themſelves new paſſages to finde out the treaſures of nature and art; which ſeeing PANSOPHY both teaches, and in a good part by Gods helpe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes; no good and wiſe man who delights in the well-improving and promoting humane things can finde in his heart to envy, much leſſe hinder it: The matter of it ſelf ſpeaks that.</p>

They diſpute that they may diſpute, not for determining, but fixing and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Controverſies.

Moreover Diſſentions and Diſputes, yea Sects have too much prevailed in Philoſophy and Divinity, in which both the learned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned are wrapped and encumbred: So as either they cannot underſtand themſelves mutually, or although they might underſtand one another, yet neglect it out of favour to ſides and parties; which thing is the originall of ſeverall confuſions: For while we doe not one underſtand the words of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, it falls out that we neither underſtand things, unleſſe it be confuſedly or amiſſe; and while we caſt abſurdities upon one another, we our ſelves ſeeme or are obſerved to cherriſh farre greater in others; nor is there any one who can efficaciouſly decide Controverſies, while we doe not edifie in common; but ſliding into Parties or Factions, every man buſily goes about to fortifie his owne Fabricks but to overthrow others with any kinde of undermining and poſſible craft; By which very thing, Sects are not leſſened but fixt and ſetled; variances are not taken away but mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed; odiums are not appeaſed, but exaſperated and ſharpened without end. O that God therefore would have pity on us, and recollect us from this diſperſion, and reſtore to us (as he hath promiſed by his Prophets, and as I have touched before) one heart, and one way, and choſen lip, that we may underſtand the ſame things, ſpeak the ſame things, doe all the ſame things, and ſerve the Lord with

Now this, if as it is wiſhed for, ought alſo to be hoped, it may ſcarce be obtained by any other, ſave a Panſophicall way: Namely, if the mindes of all men be brought into the open field of things themſelves, and there prejudices being layd aſide freely view not opinions of things but things themſelves: by no other guide then ſenſe, by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light then of ſound reaſon, by no other umpeer and judge then God. And for as much as things are the ſame to all, and all have the ſame ſenſes, and there is the ſame reaſon judging alike, of the like things; and laſtly the ſame God atteſting the ſame touching the ſame things, why ſhould we be out of hope, of having it come to paſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

There is now another Fowle and deadly monſter which in this age, if ever hath ſtrongly begun to infeſt mankind, and comes to bee quelld with the greateſt Herculean labour, <hi>viz</hi> that moſt wicked prophaneneſſe, which they call Atheiſme. This, whether it come from the multitude of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, as ſome thinke, (becauſe many a one ſeeing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169741:31"/> things various and contrary to be beleeved, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and brought to that paſſe at length, that he beleeves Fayth is nothing elſe but a meere fable) or whether it proceede from the itch of ſinning, through hope of impunity, if ſo bee a puniſher of things done amiſſe may be denyed, as the Scripture intimates, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1. or whether it ariſe from a ſawcy and malapert wantonneſſe of wits, ruſhing irreverently upon all things yea, even upon God, whom at length the very brightneſſe of his Majeſty oppreſſeth, blindeth, and drives to a reprobate ſenſe: it is certaine thoſe fooles are not a wanting in our age; who ſay in their hearts there is no God, becauſe there want no occaſions of ſliding thereto, <hi>viz.</hi> the baſe confuſion of Religions, the horrid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of hainous offences, the laviſh licentiouſneſſe of wits. It's meet therefore that we think of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies again and again; if we be touch'd with the glory of God, if we have a care of the ſecurity of our faith and hope; if the commiſeration of our periſhing neighbours affect us: and this by ſo much the more, by how much we perceive this plague to be the more creeping on, eſpecially in the mindes of Polititians, who hold it commonly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt their ſecrets of State, that they may uſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for a pretext, to take and awe the vulgar withall. Now what kind of remedy may we ſeek for Atheiſme? the word of God, which is the power of God to ſalvation to every one that believes, can
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169741:31"/> do nothing here, becauſe they do not believe it. As for miracles, by which they might be wrought upon to believe, God uſes not to put forth any for the convincing of Atheiſme; becauſe his ordinary workes may ſuffice in this caſe, as one of great note ſaith: Therefore theſe things are ſeriouſly to be urged, to the confuſion and ſhaming of thoſe fools. It's true, as ſaith the renowned VERULAM, that a ſmattering of naturall Philoſophy inclines men to Atheiſme: the deeper knowledge thereof brings them about to Religion, when by the chaine of things connexed or link'd within themſelves, it leads them to God and providence. There will ſcarce then be found out any remedy of more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for the ſubduing and overthrow of this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, then a fuller, truer, and quite ſeverer and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter knowledge of things themſelves, that they may grope by ſenſe, and thereby lay cloſe and faſt hold on reaſon it ſelfe, which Panſophy both ſeeks after and hopes for. Thence there is hope it may be effected, that Atheiſts being compelled to heare the teſtimonies of all creatures, touching the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, may bee conſtrayned at length to adde their owne; or being caught and held in cloſe bee forced to deny themſelves rather then God: <hi>viz.</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to the abſurdities of the Scepticks, that there is no ſenſe of things, no things, no world, no men who may diſpute of theſe things. Brought to which iſſue, they ſhall either yield themſelves conquered,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169741:32"/> or it ſhall appeare they are fooles who ſaying there is no God, deny themſelves, the world, and all things.</p>
                  <p n="55">LV. Laſtly, this Age hath need of ſome moſt preſent remedy againſt Phrenſie, with which a great many men being ſurprized, run on furiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their mutuall deſtruction. For we ſee the devouring and deadly flames of diſcord and wars paſſe through the whole world, deſtroying King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Nations with that pertinacy as all may ſeeme to have conſpired for their mutuall bane, not likely to give over, unleſſe it be with their owne and the worlds ruine: There is nothing therefore, which at this time may be ſo neceſſary for the world to ſtay it ſelfe that it doe not utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly periſh, as ſome univerſall inſtauration of mens mindes, and for this likewiſe an univerſall peace and concord powred forth as it were upon all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. Now I underſtand by Peace and Concord, not ſo much that externall agreement of Princes and Countries amongſt themſelves (which is a ſlippery buſineſſe, and ſubject to be changed on ſmall and ſlender occaſions) as that inward accord of mens mindes in regard of tenets and opinions which poſſeſſe them: From which, if this may be obtained, man-kinde hath much which it may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly promiſe it ſelfe. For opinions about fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing or avoyding things, as they ceaze on mens mindes, ſo they ſtir up turbulent, or beget calme
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:169741:32"/> affections; and if they be the ſame they bring forth the ſame inclinations, deſires and endeavours for good or evill, according as they are themſe ves: We may therefore vainely hope that the mindes of men may any other way be brought to good and quiet affections, then by the encouraged ſtudies of Piety, Humanity, and Wiſdome, which wiſe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity hath gallantly expreſſed in that faigned nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Theater of ORPEEUS, where all Beaſts and Birds being gathered together, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their naturall appetites (of praying, ſporting, fighting) ſtood friendly and ſweetly by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe ſound as often as it ceaſed, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures forthwith returned to their diſpoſition. By which Apologue they taught us, that men who are by nature moſt greedy of gaine, pleaſure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, ſo long as they give eare to the Precepts of Religion and Wiſdome, ſo long they entertaine peace and ſociety among themſelves; if theſe be ſilent they fall into Seditions, Tumults, and ſalvage cruelty. Yea the Holy Scripture teacheth us the ſame, as it makes mention how the turbulent ſpirit of wicked SAUL could not be compoſed by any other way then by DAVIDS Harpe, and how the ſpirit of godly ELISEUS being moved with zeale, could not be recalled to tranquility without the like harmonious conſent: What therefore hath the tumultuous world need of ſave ſome harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Harpe, that it may come to it ſelfe? And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:169741:33"/> Seditions have not layd hold on ſome few Countries ſomewhat nearer, or more adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one another, but have even ſurprized the whole World; ſo as all the Kingdomes of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and what ever remaines of Infidell Nations riſe up one againſt another, and the Weſt is daſht againſt the Eaſt, and the North againſt the South; and indeed by the concurrence of ſacred and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane cauſes, for their Country and Religion. For ſo extraordinary a diſeaſe there is even need of an extraordinary univerſall remedy, viz. of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement of mens mindes into ſome univerſall concord: For the obtaining which, PANSOPHY by its owne deſirable Panarmony, or generall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement will be fit and convenient, or elſe there will be ſcarce any other medium under Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="56">LVI. The occaſions which the moſt wiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of our God, fencing in a way to ſome moſt faire and great worke, affords to make us bold in our deſires to conceive ſuch great matters as theſe, to preſume of them through hope, to talke and write of them, and finally to attempt them by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our hands thereto.</p>
                  <p n="57">LVII. The firſt of theſe is the Commerce of Ages and Countries ſo rarely diſcovered of late. For hitherto the affairs of men were practiſed, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and tooke increaſe by parts in Mechanicks, and Liberals; and this indeed ſparingly through Nations and Ages, even in a way alſo unknowne

Now we are come to that paſſe, that by the benefit of Printing all the Monuments of Antiquity being drawne out of darkeneſſe, may be communicated to the wits of our Age, and by the found out meanes of Navigation, Commerce, or Traffick, may be haply entered on with all the Nations of the World. Whence by the emulation of Wits raiſed by this and that meanes, men have begun to ſweat exceedingly in the ſearching out of new Inventions for ſome certaine latter luſters of yeares: But that very thing for the moſt part, rather by the private induſtry of certaine perſons then in Common. What therefore may forbid us to aſſay it after a ſort, the things of the whole World which have been, and are to be obſerved, which are and may be invented, may at length be made Common to all? To wit that all who are and ſhalbe admitted into the Theater of Gods wiſdom, may be taught to attend what may be done, and to ſtir up themſelves with mutuall alacrity to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve more, and greater things conſtantly; for the wiſdome of God will never faile to ſhew forth his Acts and Spectacles to the World. We muſt aſſay this with the good leave of God the preſident of our affaires; to whoſe glory it redounds to have very many, and very attentive Spectators of thoſe ſhewes which his wiſdome manifeſts in his Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that ſuch great workes be not without full witneſſe and full admiration.</p>

The happy ſucceſſes of wits hitherto, about the poliſhing certain perticular things, &amp; the now fit piles of materialls particularly elaborated for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiving ſo great a ſtructure, give us alſo an occaſion of atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pting Panſophy.

                  <p n="59">LIX. The third thing which we deſervingly interpret, an occaſion of our now entring on ſo great a work as this: xThat we ſee many in this our age, being deſirous of proficiency for the better la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to this end, by a certain ſecret, and good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, that they may Epitomize Sciences, and Arts, how diffuſed and large ſoever, and that they may <q rend="margQuotes">free them of rubs and thorns and commend them to a great ſort by the addition of an artificiall Method;</q> and by this Compendium to render men the more Learned. For we interpret thoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious endeavours of diverſe men of our age to tend hither, who have compiled and communicated to the world Pandects, and Syntagma's, and Bodies, and ſummes of Encyclopedies, and Panſtraties, and of Divinity, Philoſophy, Law, Phyſick, and Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alſo of humane wiſedome, transformations of Sciences, great inſtaurations, Chriſtian omniſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169741:35"/> and ſuch like works: whoſe endeavour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing things manifold into one, things diſperſed into order, things obſcure into light, if it do not diſpleaſe good minds, why ſhould ours diſpleaſe, who perſwade to the making out of all things ſome one, even more generall and common than all thoſe, and more accommodated to Univerſall ends? Certainly, as in things individualls next of all make the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> the <hi>ſpecies</hi> the <hi>genus,</hi> the <hi>genuſes</hi> the moſt generall <hi>genus;</hi> ſo in the conceipts of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, a very gradation requires that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar things be contracted into ſummes, and ſummes into a ſumme of ſummes.</p>
                  <p n="60">LX. Laſtly, the hidden inſtincts of our owne heart, and motives ariſing otherwaies, and both the deſires and exhortations of ſo many pious men (after the grounds of our purpoſe grew ſomewhat known) cannot but be a document that even by this means the moſt wiſe Counſell of the Deity is a making way for ſome thing, if we afford our ſelves obſequious inſtruments to him. For God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſince they do nothing in vain, how can it be in vain that he puts into us theſe deſires of ſo great a matter, and that he gives us to ſee <hi>medium</hi>'s of its poſſibility, and finally diſcovers the manner of thoſe <hi>medium</hi>'s more evidently day by day? that nothing may ſeem to remain, but that we earneſtly purſue and haſte forward the worke even to an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py effect. Inaſmuch as God when he offers us any
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169741:35"/> thing, would have us embrace it; when he goes before, he would have us follow; when he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhews us a patterne, he would have us expreſſe it by immitation, and perfect it by our very pains: Let them make me a Sanctuary (ſaid he to Moſes) that I may dwell amongſt them: according to all that I ſhew thee after the paterne of the tabernacle, and the patterne of all the inſtruments thereof, even ſo ſhall ye make it, Exod. 25.8.9.</p>
                  <p n="61">LXI. Yet we muſt anſwer to the objections of certaine perſons not rightly attending the ends and meanes of our Panſophicall purpoſe, that they may not render it obſcure, and caſt a myſt thereon.</p>
                  <p n="62">LXII. Many a one will be ready to ſay, theſe enterpriſes relliſh much of ſtrangeneſſe, and raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I anſwer: To thinke of the amendment of humane affairs, and to wiſh and endeavour it, is not ſo ſtrange a buſineſſe; ſo as even from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our confuſions, God, and by the example of God, all good and wiſe men have been wont to do the very ſame thing, according as neceſſity requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and occaſions did invite, or the matter it ſelfe did permit: How therefore can it be tax'd or accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of raſhneſſe, which is done by ſo great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours? And if it be no raſh thing to view and behold the works of God; to obſerve the footſteps of the wiſedome of God, diſpoſing all things ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their proper ends. Laſtly, to diſpoſe all ones matters according to the will of God: Now God
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169741:36"/> commands all theſe things, upbraiding thoſe that do otherwiſe with ſtupidity and dulneſſe. It will likewiſe not be a raſh thing to invite others to eye the works of God, and to teach them how they may act all their affairs not raſhly, but by reaſon, and to exhort and help on men, that all perſons in all things (mending the intention of the ſupreame Deity) may yield themſelves ſervants to it. By what means ſoever that be done, ſo it be done after the imitation of our heavenly Father (who what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he doth, doth it for Mens ſake, and wills that all men ſhould be ſaved, and come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth; and both teaches and leads all men in the ſame wayes to the ſame place) its a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy buſineſſe. Now PANSOPHY ſeeks for no other thing, than the manner and way, whereby all things may be ſo diſpoſed to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of mankind, and indeed to commune uſes, by common <hi>medium</hi>'s, that the common welfare of all expoſed to the cleare light in each ones eye, may allure, and raviſh all to it and to God the Authour of our welfare.</p>
                  <p n="63">LXIII. They ſay: what! do you think the Church hath been deſtitute of ſuch <hi>mediums?</hi> They are not by Gods grace a wanting: if ſo be men would not be a wanting to themſelves. I anſwer: But this is the very thing which is here ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that men may be in ſome ſort efficaciouſly taught, not to be a wanting to themſelves. And
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169741:36"/> becauſe thoſe accuſtomed <hi>medium</hi>'s are grown too much out of uſe, we perſwade that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed according to Gods command. Break up your fallow ground (Jer. 4.3.) nor yet by feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any new thing, but by preparing the ancient wayes of the goodneſſe and wiſdome of God, that man ſhaking off drowſineſſe and ſleep, may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to new helps. For we know, God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, the beſt innovation is, when the ancient wayes are reduced, as God commands, Jer. 6.16. Thus therefore perſwading things to be innovated or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, that men being called back to the ancient books of God and the Lawes of Nature, Scripture, Conſcience, all may both be illuminated, and amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all things, and through all things after that moſt ancient manner, which was of God: What do we but that which God commands? we teach men to ſtand in the wayes and ſee, and aske for the old paths, where is the good way, that walking therein they may finde reſt for their ſoules, Jer. 6.16.</p>
                  <p n="64">LXIV. Now they go on to deſire to know all things (which PANSOPHY goes about) is a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep of the curioſity of our firſt Parents, which we hitherto dearly pay for, and to inſtill into men the love of a certaine Omniſcience, is a kinde of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine act. I anſwer. 1. Its cuſtomary and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall for God to change evill into good, and a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment into a benefit. The diviſion of tongues
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169741:37"/> was a penalty inflicted on mans pride: Now the Holy Ghoſt when he would that the grace of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſhould be diſperſed amongſt the Nations that were divided in tongues, he tooke not away tongues, but diſtributed himſelfe into tongues; by a divine artifice improving and conſecrating <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or the variety of tongues, being the bond of humane confuſion, to a remedy againſt confuſion. 2. Furthermore, the deſire of greater knowledge, was then raſh, when it was unprofitable in the ſtate of integrity; where man being furniſhed with a full degree of light, enjoyed the fellowſhip of his Creator, and might have enjoyed his happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe without end, being ignorant of the contrary: Now after that he was averſe from God, he loſt God his light, and through the darkneſſe of his minde was involved in infinite evils, and knew no way of ridding himſelfe of them: He hath alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether need of light, in which he may both ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſurrounding dangers, and his God again reſtoring himſelfe unto him, that is, that he may know the way of eſcaping miſery, and recovering happyneſſe: For becauſe a contrary is not expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led but by a contrary, againſt darkneſſe there's no remedy beſides light; nor any other againſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny confuſions of our minde, ſave a diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things, that Sathan that old Impoſtor may no more ſo eaſily deceive us. 3. Therefore God in this our ſtate doth forbid us no longer, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169741:37"/> us rather to try all things, that that which is good may be more certainely found out, and more eaſily retained. Hence are theſe ſpeeches of God: See I have ſet before thee this day life, and good, and death, and evill: Chuſe life that thou mayſt live (Deut. 30.15.16.) alſo know and ſee that it is an evill thing, and bitter to forſake the Lord, (Jer. 2.19.) and the like: Therefore even as man then when he was forbidden the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evill, becauſe he obeyed not, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: So now when by the ſame divine Mandates, we are commanded to try all things, if we doe not obey we double the ſinne, adding now contumacy to a late raſhneſſe. The counterfeit modeſty of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHAZ did not pleaſe God, that when he was commanded to aske a ſigne of God, refuſed, ſaying, he would not tempt the Lord; as though it were to tempt God humbly and thankfully to admit of thoſe things which his bounty offers: Seeing then God ſhewes us both the neceſſity, and poſſibility, and occaſions of a certaine, truer, and more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall knowledge of all things, we ſhall be ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and blame-worthy, unleſſe we admit this with thankes.</p>
                  <p n="65">LXV. They ſay. Yet nevertheleſſe the title of PANSOPHY is preſumptuous, not agreeing with humane knowledge, ſo far as it may extend it ſelfe; it is to be left to God alone. I anſwer, we will not wrangle about the name, when we ſhall agree
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169741:38"/> about the thing. Yet we ſuppoſe there can be no cauſe, why any one may be deſervedly offended at it: For we doe not therefore attribute any thing to man, that we may detract from God; but that the glory of God may thereby the more ſhine in man his image. And if the word wiſdome or wiſe by the good leave of theſe perſons be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to man, when yet the Scripture expreſly terms God alone wiſe, (1. Tim. 1.17. Eccleſ. 1.7.) Why may the adjection of the note of univerſality ſo offend? Surely we have no ſlighter grounds to oppoſe this then PITHAGORAS had, when he changed the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Now they report that he reſpected two things: God for whom alone he would have that glorious title left, that he ſhould be called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or wiſe: Beſides he had regard to Sophiſters ad Triflers, who by the abuſe of the word reckoned themſelves among wiſe men. He therefore deſiring to recall men from the opinion of wiſdome to the ſtudies of wiſdome, added the marke of ſtudy <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>viz.</hi> a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher: Now we have other like cauſes, why we thinke another note of univerſality (<hi>viz.</hi> this <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>) ſhould be propoſed; the neglect of wiſdome, and the word Phyloſophy, Theoſophy, and the abuſe of others commonly received. Firſt of all I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt men are dull and ſluggiſh, over ſecurely leaving to God the title of wiſdome, with the thing it ſelfe, that they themſelves may grow bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169741:38"/> and performe all their owne matters raſhly, fondly, and fooliſhly; and thoſe who would be wiſe, either ſeeke to be wiſe by piece-meale about certaine particular objects, being ignorant and careleſſe of the whole compriſall of wiſdome; or ſeeke to be wiſe without God, indeed neither ayming at God, nor conforming themſelves and their affaires unto his rules. They are therefore to be called back to the Lawes and Rules of the all wiſe God, without whom as there is no Eſſence; ſo likewiſe no underſtanding, and no wiſdome, and nothing true or coherent, that all men growne skilfull in the relliſhing all things; but eſpecially divine matters may be truly rendred like to God, and as much as poſſible. The manner therfore of Science being found out whereby (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.) all men about all things, altogether may be taught to be wiſe; why may it not deſerve to be term'd, A certaine humane PANSOPHY? After the imitation of words already received, by which the fuller furniture or preparation of any thing is expreſſed by this adjection (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.) as wee may ſee on <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. Heereunto is added the abuſe of the name Philoſophy againſt Theoſophy, or Theology; and on the contrary, which they thus vulgarly diſtinguiſh, as if neither of them had any thing to do with the other, with a manifeſt wrong to truth, where therefore theſe are conjoyn'd, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169741:39"/> men are taught (as AUGUSTINE ſpeakes) both to act the Philoſophers part in ſacred things, and to be conſecrated in Philoſophy, by deſerved right the name is changed, ſo as the thing wants not its fit index or diſcoverer. Yet at laſt if the appellation PANSOPHY ſhall diſpleaſe the Church, it may be chang'd into another, even contrary, ſo as we may ſtile it inſtead of Omniſcience, or all-knowledge, Nulliſcience, or no-knowledge. For we muſt even needs come to that at length, if we ſhall conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute true PANSOPHY (which may reduce contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries likewiſe to an identity) that by how much the more a man ſees by ſo much he may note more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects both of his owne and others, the wiſeſt of men being witneſſe. Eccl. 1.15.</p>
                  <p n="66">LXVI. They object likewiſe, that we by calling PANSOPHY a certain Ladder to God, do transforme the worke of converting men into an Art which appertaines to God alone? We anſwer, as though it were indeed abſurd either to joyne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall helps, to the inward operation of the Holy Ghoſt, or to uſe a certaine prudence and art in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing theſe: when as hee is the rather abſurd who denies this: For God acts ordinarily by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums, in which mediums, there are borh men themſelves (whom God hath as Labourers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him, or co-workers, 1 Cor. 3.9) and alſo humane induſtry, which the art of method di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects. Hence ſith God promiſes a fair reformation
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169741:39"/> of the Church, he promiſes Paſtors which may feed his people with knowledge and underſtanding, Jer. 3.15. and teachers having the tongue of the Learned, knowing how to ſpeake a word in ſeaſon, Iſay 50.4. And the practiſe of the Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Chriſt himſelfe, ſhews, that they were not wont to ſet upon men without certain ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems, whom they would excite, move, convert, or convince: that tis apparant, this work conſiſts both of prudence, and a certain Art. Therefore if we make all theſe things collected into one, and by the benefit of method, accommodated to a ready uſe to be ſubſervient to God, what do we but that which is pious and juſt in it ſelfe?</p>
                  <p n="57">LVII. They ſay, there are Books enough already, and what are we the better? the world doth and will remain. I anſwer: we may be taught never to deſpaire, alwaies to hope better things, alwaies to afford occaſions and helpes, by the patience and bounty of God, alwayes renewing it ſelfe, and in different manners diſcovering it ſelfe continually with more luſtre: and moreover promiſing to theſe laſt times; a multiplication of knowledge, and light at the very evening of the world, Dan. 12.4. Zach. 14.7. Therefore let us endeavour that this be promoted, even as much as it ſhall pleaſe God by us, by reforming not onely books, but men to the diligent uſe of bookes; which PANSOPHY will do, teaching not onely all other things, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169741:40"/> the univerſall uſe of it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="68">LXVIII. Now how may the ſame book ſerve divers perſons, ſeeing divers things delight divers men; and ſome things are agreeable to the learned, other to the unlearned; ſome to believers, other to unbelievers? I anſwer: The Chymicks out of this reſpect praiſe their Quinteſſence, becauſe it is of ſo exquiſite a temperature, that being applied to all things, it beſtowes that on ſeveralls which is needfull for every one: a cooling to things hot, an heat to things cold, moiſture to dry things, and a dryneſſe to things moiſt; and therefore 'tis a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent remedy for every diſeaſe. We may pronounce ſome ſuch like commendation of this book when tis rightly trimmed and ſet out (as one which will be a certain Quinteſſence of bookes) that it will profit all, its fruit returning to every one. For by reaſon of the decent te perature of ſimplicity, with ſublimity of truth, with exactneſſe, it will come to paſſe, that by the ſimplicity of its method it may commend it ſelfe to thoſe that are ſimple, and by the ſublimity of things it may feed the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and by demonſtrating which clearly by a true faith, that nothing may be more rationall, it may raiſe delight in the faithfull, and diſpoſe Infidels to faith or render them unexcuſable.</p>
                  <p n="69">LXIX. Now heer many a one objects, thoſe who in matters of faith provoke or challenge men to reaſon, are Hereticks: Therefore PANSOPHY
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:169741:40"/> much alike aſſaying this, is worthyly to be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I anſwer: Therefore both JUSTIN MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TYR, ATHENAGORAS, LACTANTIUS, LUDO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VICUS VIVES, MORNEY, GROTIUS, and who ever elſe have by Reaſons contended for the faith againſt Infidells? For divers men may doe the ſame, ſo as it may not be the ſame, if they doe it in a different end and manner as it is heere. An Heretick in divine Teſtimonies uſes reaſon as a Judge: The Panſophiſt as a witneſſe, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands reaſon to go before, and preſigne the paths by which he may catch divine Revelation: This would have God to go before, and would have reaſon follow: Therefore an Heretick by reaſon overthrows the Tenets of faith; a Panſophiſt doth eſtabliſh them. He joynes the Creature with the Creator, this ſubordinates: He teaches reaſon to ſpeake againſt faith, this makes reaſon ſpeake for faith, that they who doe not admit the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of God (Atheiſts and Infidells) or corrupt them by their naughty reaſons (Hereticks, Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Smatterers) may be conſtrained by the force of their owne reaſon, and may be brought to that paſſe, that they may be compelled to ſtand for God and his truth againſt themſelves; that is to ſay, to acquieſſe in the word of God, and not reſiſt it. In ſumme our God deſerves that to his mouth the mouthes and hearts of all men atteſt, and be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to atteſt, which things PANSOPHY ſeekes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p n="70">
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:169741:41"/>LXX. What doe you hope then (ſay they) that there will be no contradictions? But there will alwayes be Hereſies, I anſwer: I believe wicked men will alwayes be Rebels to light while the World continues (Job 24.13.) But ſhal we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neglect to light Candles, becauſe they are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to ſuch as are blinde, or to purifie their flames by ſnuffing, becauſe ſome lurking fellow delights more in darkneſſe? We know there muſt be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, nor are they ever like to be wanting, which is the reſtleſſeneſſe and craft of Sathan. Shall we not therefore have a care to remove and rid them out of the way, as often as God doth give occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Its the part of the ſonnes of light to oppoſe, what way they can, the Kingdome of darkneſſe, and to put lighted Candles in Candleſticks in the houſe of the Church, that they may give light to all who are in the houſe, the event being commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God. It's meet therefore to ſuppreſſe what darkneſſe ſoever we are able to vanquiſh by the power of light; although the Prince of darkneſſe, is like never to be a wanting to his occaſions, to caſt darkeneſſe even upon new light. For Chriſt the light of the world converts againe that very thing into an occaſion of detecting new light: To whom indeed 'tis uſuall to transfer all the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of his enemies, even their very ravings into an occaſion of manifeſting his glory (Pſal. 16.10.) The more Sathan brings in darkneſſe, the more
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:169741:41"/> ſhall the ſplendor of divine light be diſcloſed, and a very lye ſhall ſhew the ſtrength of truth, this we may ſafely hope.</p>
                  <p n="71">LXXI. Laſtly, there are ſome who object to us our tenuity and diſabilities: How poore and meane a party are you that you ſhould dare to move ſuch great things as theſe? I anſwer: This is not to be lookt at, of what ſmall abilities we are who adviſe theſe things, but how great he is in whoſe name we adviſe, and thoſe things which we adviſe, and they for whoſe ſakes we adviſe. He in whoſe name we are bold to exhort Mortals, that they ſeeke an univerſall remedy for their confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is God, the Lord of all, ready to confirme his mercy upon all, and to eſtabliſh his truth for ever; in whoſe power it is even to open the mouth of an Aſſe, or to excite ſtones to cry out, if others hold their peace; and for whom 'tis ordinary to uſe contemptible mediums, that the glory may be his owne, not theirs, who forget that they are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in the hand of God, if even they may ſeeme ought conſidered by themſelves. The very thing which we would have to be promoted, is the glory of God, which is to be illuſtrated by all men and all things, as much as may be here under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; that from the riſing of the Sunne to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe thereof, from this preſent even for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the name of the Lord may be praiſed, and the whole earth be filled with his majeſty. They for
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169741:42"/> whoſe ſake we doe theſe things are they whereof we our ſelves are the leaſt part, yet a part, All men, to thirſt after whoſe welfare as much as our owne, he hath commanded us, who hath produced all from one blood, redeemed all by one blood, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites all to the ſame Communion of a future life, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance. He therefore who contemneth theſe things contemneth not us, but God, and the Majeſty of God, but all man-kinde, to promote whoſe glory and welfare, as much as in him lies, he either diſpiſes, or neglects, or even hinders others who doe endeavour it. As for our part, our ſlenderneſſe cannot at all incommodate or diſadvantage things which are ſo much to be wiſhed for by themſelves; when even a very fool may ſuffice to give an occaſion of a good matter: Of which ranke if we be reckoned; ye wiſe ones put forth your abilities, that whatſoever ye take notice of to be wanting in ſo great deſires, may be ſupplyed.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ost Courteous Reader, when I read theſe things in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Hiſtory; <hi>David</hi> gave to <hi>Salomon</hi> the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or pattern of the Porch and Temple, &amp; of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures thereof, and of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per chambers thereof, and of the inner Parlours thereof, and of the place of the Mercy-ſeat, and of all the Courts that he had by the ſpirit, and of all the chambers round about, of the treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the houſe of God, and of the treaſuries of the dedicate things, and for all the Veſſels of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſaying, all theſe things came to me written by the hand of the Lord, that I may underſtand all the works of this Patterne. <hi>1 Chron. 28.11, 12, 13,</hi> and <hi>19.</hi> I obſerve from thence theſe ſeven things. Firſt, that Conſultations about things ought in any wiſe to be ſent out before the things. Secondly, nor thoſe extemporall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but far going before the very things done:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169741:45"/> as <hi>David</hi> debated in Counſels about the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Temple of Jeruſalem, even ſome twenty yeares before (though all the worke was materiall;) and <hi>Salomon</hi> his ſon and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, though he was moſt richly ſupplied with all proviſion, and unuſuall wiſedome; did but ſet upon it at length in the fourth year of his reign: ſo as near upon thirty years ran out in delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the acquiring of neceſſaries. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that conſultations concerning weightier bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes ought not to be ſuperficiall, but piercing even to the inmoſt and ſmalleſt moments or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of the enterprizes. Fourthly, that all theſe things may not only be fore-thought, but alſo deſcribed and delineated: to the end that all the works of the Patterne may be better underſtood, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes. Fiftly, that thoſe are the beſt Idea's of things which come from God himſelfe: For lo <hi>Solomon,</hi> though the wiſeſt of men, is not permitted, to deviſe or contrive the forme of the Temple after his owne pleaſure; but he is bound to imitate a patterne ſhewed him by God. Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thoſe onely are to be taken and accounted for divine patternes, which are written by the hand of the Lord: to wit, whoſe forme he hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neated
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169741:45"/> in his word, or ingraven, and imprinted in his creatures. Seventhly and laſtly, that ſuch Patternes of works are not to be concealed or kept under in ſecret, but to be ſhewn and delivered into their hands, who are concerned to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and imitate them.</p>
                  <p>Which things I meant to preface at this time: Firſt, to fore-arme our preſent ſmall delineati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, againſt their judgements, who thinke it better that ſomething be done, then that it be diſputed how it ought to be done. Secondly, to mollifie their impatience, who think much, or take it ill that the worke is ſo long deferred, and the time put off in deliberations. Thirdly, to prevent their rigider and rougher cenſure of thoſe who think it ſuperſtitious to be in diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or debate, not onely ſo long, but ſo anxiouſly concerning the forme of any Booke. Fourthly, to make it apparant, that we may not onely thinke, but alſo delineate our thoughts, till we exactly underſtand all the works of our Patterne. Fiftly, becauſe I know they are not a wanting, who are of opinion, that books may be writ, either in any kind of method, as it offers it ſelfe, or in none at all: I confeſſe I ſeek ſuch a method, as I may
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169741:46"/> believe comes from the hand of God. And ſixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that I account for ſuch thoſe methods which reſemble the works of God: either which the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hand of God made, or which he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be made by the hands of men; yet ſo as the very mouth of God hath prae-deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated their Order. In the firſt rank is the very frame of the world: and each naturall body of a Plant, living creature, &amp;c. In the latter the delineation of the Tabernacle, and then of the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel:</hi> to which that wee looke ever and anon in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the true method, ſhall bee manifest. Laſtly, leſt any ſiniſterly interpret even this Act of mine, that I expoſe ſuch things to the Publick; the example of <hi>David</hi> may defend me, who delivered to <hi>Solomon</hi> before all the people the future Delineation of the Temple, which I imitate upon a two fold cauſe: Firſt, becauſe I know I ſhall dye as well as <hi>David,</hi> and it may be before I be ſuffered to ſee all that which I wiſh: Let others then behold, and have from me at leaſt a fuller <hi>Idea</hi> of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, then hitherto: Secondly, becauſe I know not certainely as well as <hi>David,</hi> that this Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neation
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:169741:46"/> is made exactly to Gods Patterne, and heereupon already immutable, and not to be changed. Let them therefore ſee it and judge, who can ſee and judge, and may they as yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe us before we ſet upon the worke, (if God command us to live and proceed.)

                  <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ith what words wiſe SOLOMON ſhuts up his Worke which hee writ of the Vanities of the World, with the ſame wee think good to begin the Deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of that work, which we wiſh may prove an antidote againſt Worldly Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. Of making many Bookes there is no end, and much ſtudy is a wearineſſe of the fleſh. This is the concluſion of the whole matter: Feare God, and keep his Commandements, for this is the whole duty of man. For God ſhall bring every work into judgement, with every ſecret thing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or evill, Eccleſ. 12.12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Where becauſe he ranks among the vanities of mortall men, both the itch of writing many Bookes (which he termes a matter of infinite la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,) as alſo that of reading (which he calls a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:169741:48"/> of the fleſh,) and counſels us ſo to obſerve the chiefe ſcope of our whole life, that before all things, and after all things, thoſe things may bee ſought and done, by which we may be advanced in the feare of God, and rightly prepared for the things which we expect and look for after this life is ended: we following this advice, againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine redouble our deſires: that there might be a Book compil'd by the common helpe of all, which might remedy humane confuſions, whoſe making ſhould not be of infinite labour, but infinite uſe; and whoſe reading ſhould not be a wearineſſe to the fleſh, but a recreation of the ſpirit, and which might not ſhew this or that by parcels, but the whole concernment of man, and might inſtruct him ſo to paſſe this tranſitory life, that he might bring with him to that dreadfull judgement, the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of his well performed buſineſſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. We deſire I ſay, that a booke be made, which one may be inſtead of all, a moſt true Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of all Divine and humane Wiſdome; in which all things may be propoſed facilely, that nothing may bee more eaſie; and briefely, that nothing be may ſhorter, and yet ſufficiently, that nothing may be more ſufficient; to wit, by conveighing the mindes of all men through all things which are and may be knowne, to him of whom, by whom, and for whom are all things, and who is both the beginning and end of our Wiſdome, that there may
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:169741:48"/> remaine nothing elſe to be learne here under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. For indeed PLATO himſelfe writ, that the life of a wiſe man is a returne to God. How much more then doth it become us Chriſtians to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that our wiſdome may be nothing elſe then to be raiſed, drawne, and rapt through all things, and by the aſſiſtance of all things unto God?</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. To which end if we enter upon our ſacred Philoſophy, it will alſo happen that none of theſe inferiour things, by which as by a reared Ladder, we elevate our ſelves to that high one inhabiting his eternity, can ſo much as hold us amongſt them, and yet both delight and feed, and after their ſort ſatisfie us more and better, then thoſe whom they doe hold and entangle: Namely, if the largeneſſe of our Kingdome, the Univerſe by an artificiall brevity be preſented to our mindes entire; and if by an artificiall facility diſcovering the reaſons of all things, our mindes be let in into the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof; and laſtly, if by an artificiall ſolidity of a thorough handling theſe things, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the mindes of men being rid of infinite winding and wandring ambages of opinions and imployments, may be bound to the plaine and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall grounds of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num, Verum, Bonum:</hi> And if by that means, the ways to jars, erronious tenets, &amp; vain ſtudies, &amp; occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s may be ſtopt (as much as poſſible) that they may not ſpread ſo licentiouſly.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. The fundamentall reaſons of which matter,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169741:49"/> becauſe ye have already ſeene in the Ichnography of the Panſophicall Temple: Now the manner whereby wee may hope ſuch a thing may bee brought to paſſe, is to be diſcloſed, which we ſhall diſpatch in this preſent Orthographicall Delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame Temple.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The outward face of an erected building, is wont to be drawne for this end, that men may more eaſily and exactly judge concerning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the whole, and of the parts. An Idea of which manner of proportion if we borrow from the draught of the Temple of God in EZE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KIEL theſe things ſhould be obſerved; that the whole building be foure-ſquare, and all the parts thereof, and the parts of parts (the Gates, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward Courts, the Tables, Altars, &amp;c.) ſquare, and all things conſiſting of lines meere parallell and perpendicular, and all things open, plaine, expoſed to a free paſſage; laſtly, that whatſoever riſes up to any height, may by ſtaires made before hand, be ſo connexed and knit with the lower, that nothing may remaine inacceſſible, even to the very tops of the Temple.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. For the imitation then heereof, we lay downe before all things foure hinges of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of wiſdome; to which all things of it ſhall have reſpect, Fulneſſe, Truth, Eaſineſſe, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, all theſe exact.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Which foure things, verily certaine
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169741:49"/> cenſours of Philoſophies ſeeme to have obſerved to be as 'twere cardinall or principall matters in the fabrick of humane Science: For thoſe who reckon up the Prerogatives of Peripateticall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy vaunt of theſe foure things. 1. That none of the Philoſophers hath more matters and things then ARISTOTLE in his bookes. 2. That he hath carefully ſearcht out the Reaſons and Cauſes of things. 3. That he uſes a brave, round, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and efficacious kinde of ſpeech. 4. That laſtly he hath been more obſervant of Method then his Predeceſſours. (Thus ALSTED hath it in the fourth Book of his Encycl. cap. 8.) which if they be liked off in ARISTOTLE, or any other good Authour (now they cannot but pleaſe cleare mindes) they are to be obſerved ſurely ſo much the more, yea moſt of all in this Booke of chiefeſt care and exactneſſe. To wit, that heere (1) All the Reaſons, (2) Of all things may be explained, (3) In moſt perſpicuous language, and (4) In a moſt exquiſite Method, then which there can be no better.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. The plenitude or fulneſſe therefore of things and matters ſhall be the firſt hinge of PAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOPHY, on which all the buſineſſes of it ſhall mainely reſt in the whole, and in every part of it: In the whole, that the whole Univerſity of things may be ſeene heere; to wit, the world with all its fulneſſe. Nor ſo onely as 'tis now, but even as
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:169741:50"/> it was before it was, and ſhall be after it ſhall not be; together with God its admired and adored Preſident: For we muſt performe that for PAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOPHY, which in vaine, SENECA wiſht for Philoſophy; that as the face of the univerſall world comes into view, ſo that might be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us as a ſpectacle moſt like unto the world, (Epiſt. 90.) For that which he addes, is a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for us, whoſe ſight failes in what's next, that all ſeveralls may more eaſily be ſhewen to us, not as yet capable of the Univerſe, that the ſage man ſaw the Univerſe was to be ſubdued unto Wit, but could not be ſo as yet. He toucheth not the cauſes of impoſſibility, becauſe perhaps he did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them: Now they are manifeſt to us, for there was a defect of Principles; eſpecially of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, by the aſſiſtance whereof thoſe things which are without our ſenſes, and have beene before the memory of men, and which ſhall be after us, might have beene made knowne: And alſo the lack of ſenſuall obſervations from fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt Ages. But whereas to us God hath both ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed that defect of Principles by his word; and alſo obſervations continued for ſo many Ages, have encreaſed the treaſures of experiments; why may there not be hope afforded us now of the capacity of the whole Univerſe? Let us then contemplate it no longer by parts onely, but all things in their whole compaſſe, as they flow from eternity,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:169741:50"/> and flow backe into eternity, by the wayes and meanes accommodated to the Lawes of eternity it ſelfe: which let us diſcover to the world if we can, that men may begin to be wiſe, not by peece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale, but wholely: filling all the Court of the mind with all ſolidity of learning.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. This fulneſſe of things in PANSOPHY will not conſiſt with it ſelfe before it ſhall be manifeſt, that a certaine ſeat is aſſigned, or indeed meet or fit to be left to univerſalls and ſeveralls, which are in the treaſures of humane and divine wiſdome, whether they be extant already, or as yet conceal'd. Alſo whatſoever may be ſpoken profitably and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily of every thing, ſhall appear it may be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here, or ſurely that the fountaines are open, and the channels rightly diſpoſed, ſo as it may be drawne out from thence; to wit, that whatſoever any man ſpeaks, writes, thinks, endeavours, acts, he may act or do part of thoſe things whereof here ſhall be the whole.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI To be able to obtain which by any other meane we have had no hope, but that by fixing our laſt end, (for which even we and the world are, and all thoſe things which ſurround us here, and come either to be viewed, done, uſed, or enjoyed by us, to wit, by our happineſſe in God) as the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis and ground of the whole work: all the raies of our knowledge from all parts may be referred, as it were, to this Centre, and to this laſt eternall bound
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169741:51"/> all theſe things which go before in the flux or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of time, may be ſubordinated as mediums to their end. Which how it may be diſpatch'd by us, the Spectators ſhal ſee a little below in the draught of Panſophicall method. Here they are advertiſed only that the fulneſſe of things is the firſt, and ſo the primary buſineſſe which they are to minde and judge of in this draught of the Panſophical Temple.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. The ſecond hinge herof we have made Truth, which in like manner all things ſhall regard. For to this Heavenly Nymph wee have dedicated a moſt religious altar in the Temple of PANSOPHY; to which there ſhall be no open acceſſe, for any feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and bad opinion: leſt therefore any vain, falſe, or counterfeit buſineſſe might preſſe in hither, wee will have Guardians of unſpotted fidelity, things themſelves, and Teſtimonies concerning things from the mouth of God; with the proper ſenſe of every man, and reaſon well forfeited againſt aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: that heere no man may have need to feare the meeting with colourable deceit in any thing. Heere then touching all things are gathered all truths, (hitherto commonly ſcattered here and there) and with ſuch evidence and clearneſſe they are reduced to their Radixes, as the mindes of all men may be captivated to an eternall compliance with unmoved truth; and the confeſſion of what is true, may at length alſo be wrung from ſuch as ſtrive againſt it, or if any continue oppoſite and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169741:51"/> he may be convinc'd he denounceth warre to common ſence, and his conſcience, and things, that is, to man-kinde, himſelfe, and God. And this ſhall be the ſecond very great buſineſſe, which the ſpectator ſhall give heed to, whether truth be delivered here with that evidence and certainty, as it cannot be contradicted (for he ſhall ſee a little beneath a Proofe or Say of its method.) If he ſhall take notice tis otherwiſe, he ſhall perceive we do not yet attain our ayme in that poynt, and leave the victory to others.</p>
                  <p>For that even all may eaſily judge concerning theſe things, who being endowed by God with a ſound minde, ſhall come to contemplate the ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Panſophicall Temple, we have purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to effect by perſpicuity or clearneſſe of ſpeech; which we have layd downe as the third univerſall hinge of this whole ſtructure. For after (the chiefe and never to be intermitted) reſpect of truth, the principall care ſhall be, that all may underſtand whatſoever ſhall be delivered. Which by what way I thinke it may be obtain'd, I muſt tell you plainly.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. Wee altogether avoyd as Rockes and Shelves thoſe obſcure and perplexed termes of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Notions, as they call them, with which even almoſt all books of vulgar Philoſophy and Theology do not ſo much abound, as they appeare rough and ragged with their ſtiffe prickles. For
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169741:52"/> what need is, there I ſhould ſpeak ſo as none may underſtand, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſcant a few, if I can ſpeak that all may underſtand? I'le give an inſtance. One being minded to deſcribe exactly the office or part of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, writes thus: The ſubject of Logick is of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, of tractation or handling, and of uſe. The ſubject of information is the wit; primarily indeed reaſon, but ſecundarily partly the memory, partly ſpeech. The Subject of tractation is the manner of diſcourſing well. Tis term'd otherwiſe, The ſubject of Art, as alſo of learning, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. The ſubj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ct of uſe is <hi>Ens &amp; non Ens,</hi> which is called otherwiſe the Subject of the Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and externall, &amp;c. Who I pray you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands theſe things, unleſſe he be wonted to theſe thorns by the uſe of ſome years? If I ſhall ſay, Logick informs and directs the mind in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, in ſpeaking, I have ſaid juſt the very ſame which he afore: but I have ſayd it ſo as both the Learned and unlearned may underſtand me. I have ſaid therfore more, becauſe to more; he leſſe, becauſe to fewer, although with a greater circumſtance of words, and under the ſhrouds of Riddles. Now why ſhould not I rather ſpeak ſo, as I may hope I do not ſpeak to the winde. God is wont to ſpeak to that people which he is angry with in another language, Eſay 28.11. And when he intends to confound the Builders of Babel, he confounds their tongues, Gen. 11. but when to build up Sion he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:169741:52"/> reſtores the ready uſe of the tongue that they may underſtand themſelves mutually, who could not before, Acts 2. Therefore Paul checking the praiſe of certaine perſons gotten from hence, becauſe they could ſpeak obſcurely to the unlearned, ſaith; thou verily giveſt thanks well, but the other is not edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. In the Church I had rather ſpeak five words with my underſtanding, that by my voyce I might teach others alſo, than ten thouſand words in an unknown tongue, 1 Cor. 17.19. which if it be to be imitated any where, then certainly here, where in the face of the whole Church, yea, of man-kind, for the common edification of all men, things come to be explained by words.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. We have no mind to depart yet from this hinge: becauſe there is hope of much proficiency, if this pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fe of obſcure termes hitherto worne, and deſervedly by an unprofitable uſe worne out, be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. Indeed diſcreet and underſtanding men thanked TICHO BRAHE, becauſe he removed out of Aſtronomic Orbs Reall, Eccentrick, Epicy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Deferents, Aequants, and the reſt of that uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſtuffe, teaching perfectly the Heavenly moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in plainer hypotheſis. Why therfore do we not attempt the ſame in all things which may bee known? to get rid of ſo many ſuperfluous, obſcure, rough, yea monſtrous terms: through which they muſt paſſe as through thorns, who go to the green and pleaſant walks of Sciences, and wherewith a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:169741:53"/> good many being prickt, are either in great feare to venter, and withdraw; or march through not without being hurt, and raiſed with the moſt rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged conceits of the mind. But now if we can want ſuch, and explain things plain of themſelves, by plain words, which may be intelligible to all, what need have we of entanglements and trifling lets? SENECA ſayth well: As it is a poynt of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury to deſire delicate things: ſo tis a part of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to refuſe ſuch as are ordinary, and may be had at any eaſie rate. Philoſophy requires frugality, not pennance (Ep. 5.) Let us therfore either do this, that all knowable things may be delivered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that manner, as they may be apprehended by every mans underſtanding readily, of their own accord, without an interpreter; or we do nothing. We becauſe we have taken pitty of youth, which have every where ſo many torturing vexations, without neceſſity do aſſay to take away thoſe, or if need require any terms to be retain'd to mollifie them by a meet ſcituation, and good definition. How well may the learned judge if they ſhall but ſet aſide prejudice? Of whom yet if we do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their approbation, we will appeale to Infants, little ones, and Idiots, who if they ſhall apprehend our things better, truth it ſelfe ſhall acquieſſe in their judgements. For it is no new or ſtrange thing for little ones to applaud the teacher of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall truth, the Seniors perſevering in their accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169741:53"/> drowſineſſe. And this ſhall be the third prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall thing which the Spectators ſhall obſerve, whether theſe our matters be ſo cleare as they may be underſtood eaſily by any one? For which buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (as I have already ſayd) there is none but may be a competent Judge; yea perhaps, the ignoranter and ſimpler any one is, the more fit he may be.</p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. The fourth hinge of our attempt, which will contribute wonderfull ſtrength to the whole edifice of PANSOPHY, is concinnity or neatneſſe of method: which we will have to be ſuch as they who ſhall travell through theſe things, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the conceptions of their mind to be knit as cloſe to themſelves, as they ſhall ſee the very things joyne themſelves together in the Univerſe. Which that it may be had at length by the help of method, it was long agoe to be wiſhed, that we might not alwayes teach on that manner, that Scholers might remain Scholers, and Teachers Teachers, (as SCA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIGER ſpeaks,) or that we might alwayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long and never determine brawls and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. What we may endeavour here, and with how great properneſſe and aptneſſe we may intend to couple things with things, and link them to mens minds, we muſt now bewray. And this ſhall be the fourth thing which the ſpectators ſhall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally mark.</p>

                  <p n="18">XVIII. Perpetuall Coherence is in this, that all things, the greateſt and the leaſt, from the firſt even to the laſt, ſhall be chain'd together, and one thing ſhall ſo depend upon an other, that nothing of all thoſe things which are any where, may either eſcape or chance to be ſeen in any other then its own place. Hitherto becauſe things and words lay for the moſt part ſcatteringly, nor rightly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in their Claſſes or ranks, nor bound up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves with perpetuall ties: it could not be otherwiſe, then that even ſcatteringly and onely occaſionally for the moſt part, there ſhould both be found out, and carried together into a mixt maſſe, obſervations of things and words out of which Rules were made and diſperſed through divers heapes of Diſciplines (whereof there was neither certaine number nor order;) but the marriage of things and words being found out and eſtabliſhed by intervening bonds of right conceipts (if conceits accurately and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually abſtracted from things, may again accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and punctually imprint themſelves in words,)
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:169741:54"/> it will be impoſſible for any thing to eſcape, which may not come into order.</p>
                  <p n="19">XIX This to wit is look'd after, that as all things which are and may be thought and ſpoken, are one world knitting it ſelfe together on every ſide by its fulneſſe: ſo what things are thought and ſpoken of that whole Univerſity of things, may be but one Syſtem of our knowledge unſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in it ſelf, and ſo knitting it ſelf together on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſide by its parts, that neither there may be need for any thing to be omitted, nor twice repeated: and every thing may be beheld ſtanding handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no other where then in its own place. So it will come to paſſe at length, that this work may be moſt like to the world, from which nothing can be withdrawn without ruine, or certainly a foule breach; nor any thing put to, or put otherwiſe without notable monſtrouſneſſe. And that it may appeare what was believed formerly as impoſſible, that a verſe could be taken from HOMER, that may be ſpoken by better right of the Panſophicall work.</p>
                  <p n="20">XX. The like concatenation of things and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits may be had if we go in a perpetuall Analyſis through the univerſity of things; to wit, from the firſt &amp; higheſt conceit of <hi>Ens</hi> through all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of things, even to the laſt, and unpartable points of differences, as far as they may be noted: ſpeaking of ſeveralls by and by whatſoever we muſt ſpeake in the ſame place.</p>
                  <p n="21">
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:169741:55"/>XXI. Now in truth there is need of a quite new Analyſis of things: becauſe thoſe which we yet have, are not ſufficient for this uſe. Eſpecially thoſe famous ten Predicaments of ARISTOTLE, to which men vulgarly believe that all things may be recalled as to the chiefe <hi>genuſes</hi> of things: yet how thoſe <hi>genuſes</hi> may be divided even into the moſt ſpeciall <hi>ſpecieſes,</hi> neither ARISTOTLE, nor any other ſhews us. Whence it came to paſſe that the contemplators of things erred in the univerſity of things and conceits, as it were in an infinite Chaos; and they who aſſayd to reduce theames which were offred them to the Predicaments, (which we were bid to do oftentimes in Schools) that buſineſſe would either not ſucceed, or not without doubting and ſtraining; which is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument the veines of things were not rightly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered: as alſo this, becauſe reaſon is neither given there, nor appears by it ſelfe, why there are ſet down ſo many, no more, or fewer Claſſes of things? and why they follow one another in that order? whereas if wee had learned to obſerve aright the joints of natural co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the Univerſity of things would voluntarily reſolve it ſelfe by its limbes, and it would be fairely evident, that things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in this order and number, and not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="22">XXII. The matter therefore is to be attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anew, notwithſtanding, that LUDOVICUS
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:169741:55"/> VIVES is out of hope, that any thing may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred perfect in naturalls while he writes: To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the orders of Formes, and to call them as it were into their ranks to a muſter, and to diſpoſe them in our ſpeculation, as they are diſpoſed in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this truly he only can do who made them. For the proprieties of things, their vertues and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies are unknown to us; unleſſe perhaps in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. <hi>(lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de prima Philoſ.)</hi> now grant we do not every where obtain the full and exact order of things: yet what forbids it to be ſomewhat better ſettled? For we truſt though our induſtry faile in the diſplacing of ſubſtances by their forms, we ſhall yet ſhew a new artifice in accidents, and other <hi>Genuſes</hi> of <hi>Enſes:</hi> ſo as there may be had an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſis of things, which if it be not perfect, yet may prove the next to what's perfect.</p>
                  <p n="23">XXIII. Now we lay down theſe conditions of a perfect Analyſis of things: Firſt, that it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Univerſall, exhauſting all things; that nothing may occu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, that it be not forced and ſtrained, but diſpoſing things limbe by limbe as they reſolve themſelves of their own accord, ſenſe and (the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding being never repugnant or croſſe.) Thirdly, that cauſes may either be rendred every where or appeare by themſelves, why there are ſo many Claſſes of things, and why neither more nor
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169741:56"/> fewer, may be deviſed. This ſhall beget at laſt both pleaſantneſſe and ſecurity in Univerſall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p n="24">XXIV. Furthermore, as the world, although in it ſelfe is one undivided, yet in is parts tis clearly diſtinguiſhed for order ſake: ſo it will be neceſſary that PANSOPHY, although one continued Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme, be either divided or diſtinguiſhed into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain parts, books, and heads. Now this is not to be in any order contrived to our own liking, but in the Series which the very intention of the laſt end ſhall preſcribe; to wit, our happ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>neſſe in God, through all things which any where are either to be promoted or illuſtrated; whoſe guidance if we follow, a threefold worke will iſſue forth unto us, yet it is to bee reſolved into ſeven Sections, or Books.</p>
                  <p n="25">XXV. For before all things, it is needfull that a certain preparation of minds be premiſed to that which is undertaken to be done, which is vulgarly called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or a fore-view: in Latine <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognita.</hi> Then ſhall follow the very body of PAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOPHY, ſhewing the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or after-view, ſhall conclude, demonſtrating the true uſe of all things which are truly known.</p>
                  <p n="26">XXVI. There is need of a fore-view, or of things which are to be known afore-hand; becauſe in the producing every worke, it is requiſite the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169741:56"/> matter be pre-diſpoſed, that it may be made fit to receive the form: And why then is it not meet that men likewiſe be rendred docil, or teachable before they be taught? Truly unleſſe we will loſe our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and power the precious liquor of wiſdome into leaking tuns, it's neceſſary we begin from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives, and not from the very work; to wit, that men may begin to awake out of that drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to which mortalls are ſo much accuſtomed and inured, and be touch'd with ſome care of tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and better good things, than thoſe which they have common with Bruits. Which this Protheory of PANSOPHY ſhall ſeriouſly labour to effect.</p>
                  <p n="27">XXVII. Now the Theory it ſelfe ſhall handle things themſelves, in that order wherein they were produced they ſhall both proceed, and at laſt alſo end; which conſideration ſhall yield five eſſentiall parts of PANSOPHY. To wit. Firſt, becauſe God before he made the world had repos'd in his divine mind the Idea's of things; that is, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and formes, according to which things were to be, and are formed. And then ſecondly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thoſe Idea's, he contriv'd the frame of the World, and put into it that power which we call Nature, to continue even without end (if he would permit,) its motions and operations. And becauſe (Thirdly) he concentred the power of Nature in man eſpecially, and by it put forth himſelfe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, ſo that wonderfull works proceeded from
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:169741:57"/> the wit of man, which Nature it ſelfe could never have produc'd of which the world is full<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And yet becauſe man (Fourthly) miſcarried greatly in a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of the greateſt moment, the government of himſelfe, and thereby caſt himſelfe head-long into eternall deſtruction, and God by putting to his hand, reſtored man againe, and preſcribed him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtored new Laws, which if he keep, he avoyds ruine; if he keep them not, then he fully drowns himſelfe in the gulfe of perdition: And it will come to paſſe at length, that (Fiftly) God, this viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſcene being taken away, wil diſcover his inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Majeſty and glory to his Elect Creatures, and make them partakers of bleſſed eternity, and this ſhal be the laſt line of things, whereby God ſhalbe, and be beheld all in all. The contemplation of all theſe things ſhal afford in the ſame order five parts of PANSOPHY. In the firſt whereof we collect and contemplate thoſe general and common waies, or manners of things, according to which all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular things are, and be made. In the ſecond we have to view the whole courſe of nature: In the third the works of mans wit, which are, and ſhal be found out. There is made a paſſage from thence to conſider the myſteries of our perdition or fall, and reſtitution or recovery; which end in the ſtate of eternity</p>

                  <p n="30">XXX. In which regard PANSOPHY ſhall reſemble ſome faire tree riſing out of its own roots, leaning upon its owne, and that a firme ſtock and ſufficient to ſuſtain its bulk, diſplaying it ſelfe moſt diſtinctly into branches, and producing moſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome fruits by an enliving power or vigour diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through all parts thereof. That root of whole or entire PANSOPHY ſhal be the book of its <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognita;</hi> the Stock or Trunk of that Ideal Science, which they call PANSOPHY, vulgarly META<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHYSICKS, The Cardinall or chiefe Branches of thoſe things which are, and be ſeen in this life, are three: The contemplation of Naturals, Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials, and Spirituals. The power diffuſed through all theſe things, enlivening and quickening all things, is God inhabiting eternity, yet at once paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through, diſpoſing, and governing all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall matters. Laſtly, the fruits ſhall be the ſundry uſes of true knowledge for our preſent and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life.</p>
                  <p n="31">XXXI. The view of EZECHIELS'S Temple,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169741:58"/> and our looking upon the Entry, the Gate, and the Court, the firſt, ſecond, and third Sactuary, and laſtly, upon the fountain of living waters, gave us the like diſpoſall, as we have ſhewn in the explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Panſophicall Endeavours. But we muſt obſerve, as there the whole Temple was conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, ſave that the moſt hidden things were kept in the utmoſt inner Houſe: So in the Temple of PANSOPHY, all things ought to perſonate or ſound out God; as without whom neither is there, nor commeth there to paſſe ought, nor any other way is there referred ought, then to himſelfe. To wit, becauſe it is hee alone, of whom, by whom, and in whom are all things: it were a wicked thing ſilently to conceale ought of his praiſe. Not is this to be done, that in the end at length all things may reſolve themſelves into his glory, (which will certainly be:) but that what way ſoever we ſhal go, even from the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of this ſacred Temple; religious ears may heare and underſtand ſilent clamours of things; which will be, if to thoſe that view all things, that wiſdome alſo which reacheth from one end to another, and ſweetly ordereth all things, Wiſd. 8.1. with all things, and in all things be ſet abroad to their ſight: that where ever we ſhall be, all things, even when we are doing another thing, may erect and direct the mind unto it.</p>
                  <p n="32">XXXII. To catch at the occaſions of which
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:169741:58"/> buſineſſe there will be no need. They will in this reall diſtribution of things knowable, yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as much of their owne accord, as the very things are every where obvious and eaſie to the ſences. For in the entrance the goodneſſe and wiſdome of God will openly offer it ſelfe to be conſidered, who hath deſtinated to map an end in himſelfe, in the fellowſhip of his eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and thereto hath ordred all mediums free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communicated, and hath taught and doth teach the manner and uſe of thoſe mediums. In the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-doore he ſhall come to our contemplation and view, as the firſt cauſe of all things that are; how all things may viſibly repreſent him as their inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble root, and yet may ſhew that he infinitely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, and is above them all. In the firſt Court together with nature, the Authour of Nature offers himſelfe to be ſeen, as a hidden <gap reason="foreign">

In the ſecond Court, where mans Kingdome is paſſed through in a ſurvay; there likewiſe comes the King of Kings to our contemplation, who hath granted to man onely this dominion of things, and hath circumſcribed it with limits, and ſways, prohibits, or inhibits his Scepters according to his pleaſure. In the third Court there ſhal be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription made of mans moſt happy eſtate if he be
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:169741:59"/> under God; and of his dreadfull confuſion if he forſake his obſervance and ſlide back into himſelfe; and againe of his new bleſſedneſſe, if he inſiſt and keep in the way of obedience, which the Son of God ſent from his Father to reſtore our loſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath taught. In the Sanctuary the glory of God is preſented to our view, as the bleſſed ſhall fully behold it with open face for ever: as much of it as God ſhall think good to reveale for the preſent. And laſt of all, the way ſhal offer it ſelfe to our enquiry, whereby all theſe things being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on and put to their beſt uſes, may ſerve eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to illuſtrate and ſet forth the glory of the great God.</p>
                  <p n="33">XXXIII. Theſe things touching the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the parts of PANSOPHY where I thinke good withall to mention one thing about their number, becauſe of cenſurers. The firſt and laſt part, as they are reckoned up, may ſeeme to be no parts of PANSOPHY: ſeeing the firſt onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the laſt ſeales up minds that are to be, and are ſeaſoned with the knowledge of things. I grant I have ſufficiently comprehended the very ſeries of things in the middle body of the five parts: and ſay furthermore that two even among theſe five extreames, do after a ſort the like Preparatory, and obſignatory office. For Metaphyſick delivers nothing in ſpeciall, it layes downe onely the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral grounds of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l. Now the contemplation of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:169741:59"/> God without the creatures, is nothing but the top of that knowledge, which being gathered from the creatures went before; and whoſe perfection is yet differd for Heaven, So as it remaines that the three middle parts onely (thoſe three Courts of the Panſophicall Temple) intirely enfold and embrace all thoſe things which wee can comprehend in this life, all that proviſion of our Natural, R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tional, and Spiritual life: So tis indeed. But yet the Univerſity of things is one buſineſſe, and PANSOPHY, or the knowledge of the Univerſity of things is another. That ſtands not at all in need of our Preparations, this wholely doth. For becauſe the knowledge of things is a certain tranſplantation of the ſame into our minds, we ought not to be ignorant of that tranſplanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither of the manner how it is to be done, nor of the uſe of it being done. Therefore SOLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON when he began to know the wayes of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring wiſdome, he believed even that every thing to be a poynt of Wiſdome, Wiſd. 8 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>fore thoſe parts, the firſt and the laſt may by no meanes be ſevered or cut off from the body of PANSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHY; much leſſe the ſecond and the ſixt: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as a building without a foundation, and a tree without its trunk or main body cannot ſtand: ſo neither can the order of things, wherein all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:169741:60"/> are contained, be known without the Baſis of Order, which the firſt wiſdome diſcovers. Laſtly he cannot be ſaid to know all things, who would verily contemplate God in the creatures, and the creatures in God, but would not likewiſe know what the creature is without God, and what God is without every creature: which becauſe PANSOPHY in its laſt and deepeſt retirement, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends (by the guidance of God and his word) to meditate on piouſly, it is not to be deprived of this its laſt inner or withdrawing roome.</p>
                  <p n="34">XXXIV. The ſecond vertue of Panſophical method is Gradation: whereby things are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd with things, as alwayes and every where the latter may ſeeme of their owne accord to ariſe out of the former, and the more unknowne out of the already-underſtood Premiſes, without any skip or gap at all. Even as we ſee it to be in a tree, that the Stock riſeth from the Root, from the Stock Boughs, from Boughs Twigs; from theſe Buds, Leaves, Bloſſoms, Fruits, in an unſeperable order, whereby alwayes the latter are both produced, and ſtrengthened, and enlivened by the former. By ſuch a graduall concatenation of things we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to obtain, that the minds of Learners may not onely ſuffice to raiſe them to all things by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, but that they may likewiſe expreſſe their joy, fearing no danger of falling back or ſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: and their minds who are to be freed from
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:169741:60"/> bad opinions, ſuckt in elſewhere, and to be reduc'd to right judgements of things being detain'd by ſuch a gradation, as it were with bars and bounds, though they would f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="35">XXXV. Which to be the onely Legitimate meanes of a harmleſſe withdrawing minds accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the darkneſſe (of ignorance or errours) into the cleare light, that great Artiſt in teaching truth. AUGUSTINE both ſaw, and alſo taught in theſe words: Sore eyes are dazled with that very gliſter which they much deſire to ſee, and that being ſcarcely ſeen, they retire into the dark with delight. To which it is dangerous (though being now ſuch as may be termed rightly ſound) to offer to ſhew what as yet they are not able to ſee.

For firſt, ſome things are to be ſhewed them which do not ſhine of themſelves, but may be ſeen by the light, as a garment, or a wall, or ſome ſuch thing. Then that which not by it ſelfe indeed, but yet by the ſame light yields a braver luſtre: as Gold, Silvers and the like: yet not ſo glittering as to hurt the eyes. Then perhaps this earthly fire is to be tendered to their view modeſtly: then the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169741:61"/> Stars, then the Moone, then the gliſtering of the morning, and the ſhine of the brightning Heaven: in which (ſooner or latter, either in the whole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or in ſome things contained) every one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his healthfull ability accuſtoming of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſhall ſee the Sunne, without trembling, and with great delight and pleaſure. The beſt Maſters take ſome ſuch courſe with thoſe that are moſt ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and deſirous of wiſdome, but yet eye it not with a ſharpe ſight. For its the office or part of good Diſcipline to come to it by a certaine order; but without order it is a happyneſſe ſcarce credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Soliloq. lib. cap. 1.3. Theſe things utters that happy and prudent Teacher of truth, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way of teaching the truth prudently and efficaciouſly: which we immitating, doe purpoſe ſo to ſubordinate to themſelves mutually all things drawne out of the treaſures of wiſdome, and layd forth to the eyes of men; as it may not be a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſome extraordinary felicity, but of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diligence (through Gods mercifull aſſiſtance) to touch the tops of wiſdome.</p>
                  <p n="36">XXXVI. For even the very ſeries of the parts of PANSOPHY is in this manner graduall. For what elſe wil the <hi>Praecognita</hi> or fore-going no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of PANSOPHY be, then an eye-ſalve fitly prepared for mens dimme eyes? with which they being annoynted, they may begin to ſee their darkneſſe, and note the wayes of advancing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:169741:61"/> out of darkneſſe into light, (now ſhining forth to them after a ſort) and perceive deſires to bend their ſtudy that way. And when they ſhall begin to be willing to be wiſe in this manner, they ſhal be exerciſed, and the love of thoſe things ſhal be profitably defer'd and nouriſhed with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of generall things. to wit, of common knowledges wherein the eternall light, God, hath impreſſed certaine rudiments of his artifice in the mindes of all men: which they ſhall begin to marke here (in the firſt part of PANSOPHY) by ſurveying likewiſe certaine beams of that Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctreſs wiſdom ſhew d through al things. Then they ſhal be brought forth to behold the more illuſtrious works of God in the Court of nature: where they ſhal ſee how the wiſdome of God hath beautified with lively colours thoſe her lineaments in creating things. After this being admitted into the Court of Art, they ſhal conſider that eternall Lights thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand wayes reflex, refract, and amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by turnes variouſly contemperated rayes in a more and wonderful harmony even to aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Then ſhal be ſhewed them in their higher progreſſe at the firſt indeed that horrid Chaos and boundleſſe bottomleſſe pit of our darkneſſe, into which we, being left to our ſelves, fell; and then the brighter beames of eternall light ſent down to ſwallow this up. Laſtly mens minds ſhal be raiſed to contemplate the very ſonne of eternity, as he is

By this artifice of gradation we have hope to obtaine that mindes may by little and little inſenſibly be led on to any pitch or height, no occaſion being left either to the weake of being deceived, or to ſmatterers, and prejudicious perſons of objecting or quarrelling againſt the truth: For 'tis knowne to thoſe that are unuſed to high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if they be carryed ſuddainely to the top of a Tower, their ſight is troubled, ſo as they either tremble to looke downe, or elſe wax giddy; but if they wont themſelves to looke from leſſe high places, and raiſe themſelves by degrees, they have uſe of a firme and ſteady ſight as well on high as below; this is alſo knowne: Every matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that thing to which any one hath accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himſelfe, if it come unawars, it doth vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently amaze and trouble the ſenſes; ſo as truth likewiſe offered over ſuddainely to them who have been accuſtomed to any errour, ſets their mindes a trembling, as they ſeeme injured and oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and contradict the very truth, and wrangle with it. Therefore leſt this ſhould fall out in this place, where Barriers are not provided for fencing or fighting exerciſe, but a Temple for contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this kinde of ladder or ſcale of things ſhall beware before hand: In which even in the firſt and loweſt ſtep (in the very gate of PANSOPHY,

Each one muſt needs grant likewiſe all the reſt through whole PANSOPHY (ſo be they proceed alſo by degrees one from another) by reaſon of the already granted generall formes and rules of things, which onely he ſhall ſee applyed every where, and in no place new ones deviſed: Which furthermore ſhall ſerve to this end, that men differing in opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout particulars may be recall'd to a conſent, and even they themſelves ſtraying may be able to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect themſelves: In as much as the generall rules of truth being already granted, they ſhall not dare (in ſighting for their owne particular errour) to ſpeake againſt them; which artifice ſhall be a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine imitation of that divine ſtratagem which the Prophet NATHAN happily uſed in converting his King. For as DAVID being detained in the THE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIS pronounced againſt himſelfe, ſo as being brought to the HYPOTHESIS he was ſilent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his errour: So heere whoſoever ſhall admit, and by his aſſent approve a generall truth, ſhall by that ſame make firme and conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date foundations: At which his wandring opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons afterward daſhing may burſt aſunder, and fall to pieces of their owne accord.</p>

<p>(This appeares in a beame let in through a little hole, into a dark cloſet, where the beam is not ſeen, but upon the oppoſite wall; in which if there be a hole too, into which the beame falls, it will not be ſeene at all; unleſſe perhaps little bodies termd Atomes flie in it, or you ſet your hand afore it.)</p>

<p>(For if you ſet a Looking glaſſe over againſt a beame, the whole beame is turned back another way, and carries the image of light wholly thither: If a board, and any thing leſſe poliſht, the beame burſts aſunder, and ſpreads the image of light upon the light.</p>

For if theſe perhaps ſeeme not yet ſuch to any one, I would have him thinke, that ſomething is a want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here, which cannot be a wanting in the very body of PANSOPHY, to wit, that continuall draught of the minde, raiſing it ſelfe by degrees from one thing to another. Now we have fallen upon theſe things as it were abruptly, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus ſummarily and by parcells delivered doe ſavour of that fruſtillation or mincing of Sciences, againſt which we alwayes proteſt. I hope the more ſagacious by this eſſay given, may ſmell out the commodiouſneſſe and benefit of this Method: To wit, if the Definition of a thing exactly circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe its eſſence; the Idea reſolve it into its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: And alſo Axiomes flow of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord from either: And laſtly, the Diſtribution ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe us to proceed in the Analyſis of things, that all things ſhall be eaſie to be perceived, and ſolid for uſe. For when the underſtanding doth ſee all things riſe thus out of themſelves, that nothing is

Now it will not be amiſſe to adde, what Lawes we ſet up to be obſerved in collecting and making theſe Definitions, Idea's, Axiomes, and Partitions of things: That if we (peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture prevented by death, or letted by the labours of our ordinary calling) may not go on, thoſe that will ſucceed, need not be ignorant of our minde. For I hope it may be that Chriſt may ſend out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who may enter into our labours, and may bring on our ſeed-time to an Harveſt, that both he who ſowes, and he who reapes may rejoyce toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and gather fruit unto eternall life.

                  <p n="47">XLVII. Commonly in all theſe (Definitions, Idea's, Axiomes, and Partitions) theſe things are to be performed. 1. That all things be plaine and perſpicuous in words and ſenſe, needing as far as may be, no Commentaries, to be illuſtrated by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples onely where there's need. 2. That they may be of greateſt truth, altogether according to

For AMANDUS POLANUS (in the Preface to his Logick) writes well. <q rend="margQuotes">That the Vulgar Rules of Arts have ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo many exceptions, becauſe ſpeciall things are delivered generally contrary to the Law, <gap reason="foreign">

Therefore (ſaith he let it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved what things diſagree; and let things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing be referred under one Genus, the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing under another; ſo there will be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, but all things will be comprehended rightly in diſtributions.</q> Now againſt the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of diſtinctions, and limitations it will be a good remedy, that nothing be uſed that's ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and homonymous, but that all diſtinct things be expreſſed in diſtinct words, in the very Analyſis of things already, that not any thing at length be left to be determined by a Commentary: So it will be that even as things collected have no need to be collected, things ordered to be ordered; ſo neither may things diſtinct have need to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and things limited to be limited. 3. Let it be attended that the middle Centers of things may be found out, and expreſſed, whereby the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:169741:70"/> of contradicting may diſappeare. For the moſt Controverſies riſe from this, becauſe they are wont to exorbitate too much to the extremes on this ſide, and on that, who doe not rightly weigh the equall ballance of things about their Centers: For example ſake, in the Booke of JOB its ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſputed, whether the calamities of life oppreſſe the godly or the wicked? The firſt JOB, the latter his friends did defend. But experience teacheth (as SOLOMON taught by experience, witneſſeth, (Eccleſ. 9.1.) that neither is ſimply true, becauſe we ſee either of them happen. Therefore a cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous condition ſhall be defined (in its place) thus; that the Definition may have the power not of ſolving that Controverſie, but of taking it away. For example ſake, if you define it thus: The Calamities of this life are the Inſtrument of Divine Providence, to try the good, but to puniſh the bad: For who can doubt now, how this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie may be decided? Eſpecially when the true Idea ſhall come to it; and the Axiomes with the Partition: And it appeares too, whether that place (concerning the Calamities or miſeries of life) may be referred? To wit, to the Doctrine of Providence.</p>
                  <p n="48">XLVIII. But peculiarly we will have defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be ſuch, as out of them as well Axiomes as Ideas and Partitions may be eaſily drawne, and may flow as it were of their owne accord. Alſo, that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:169741:70"/> proofes of any of the Aſſertions may bee deduced through the very definitions of things uttered in the Aſſertion: <q rend="margQuotes">to the end that that of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher may be manifeſt to be true indeed. That the Definition if it be perfect, or next to whats per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, puts an end to controverſies: ſo as it may be called not without cauſe, the Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies.</q> The example of the former may be in the definition of <hi>Ens,</hi> which we have thus. <hi>Ens</hi> is, whatſoever is, is ſpoken, or thought.</p>
                  <p>N. W. For declaration ſake the following things may be ſubjoyned. As from <hi>Praeſum Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens, Abſum abſens, Potis ſum potens:</hi> ſo from <hi>Sum, Ens.</hi> Therefore <hi>Ens</hi> is, whatſoever it is. Yet there is added, &amp; whatſoever is ſpoken or thought: becauſe even thoſe things which are not, are wont to be ſpoken and thought: as <hi>Cerberus, Pegaſus,</hi> One-eyd <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> &amp;c. which kinde of things although they bee nothing in themſelves, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe while they are thought or ſpoken, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, they buſie or take up the mind, the tongue, the hand, paper, in that very thing they are now ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and they are not altogether nothing.

                  <p n="49">XLIX. An Example of the latter may be the ſpeech of that blind man in the Evangeliſt: God heareth not ſinners. Whether this may be true, we ſhall judge by the Definitions of God, of a ſinner, of hearing, if they ſhall be moſt fitly true. For becauſe (1) God is the Being of beings, that is, chiefly a Being, and conſequently chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

(3) Now to heare (is in this place) to heare perfectly or gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly, that is, to admit of any one freely, and to fulfill his will: how can the moſt holy, and moſt jealous God, love and promote thoſe, who (ſo long as they are ſuch) turne away themſelves from him?</p>
                  <p n="50">L. Its cleare therefore that there is great uſe of definitions, if they be ſuch as this method requires. And we muſt ſeriouſly endevour that we may have
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:169741:71"/> ſuch, though to frame and make them be a buſines of great labour and wit. For VIVES (in his book touching the explaining of Eſſences, after he had taught that a good definition is, that which is briefe, cleare, reciprocall) writes truely. <q rend="margQuotes"> The taske or worke of defining belongs to ſome great and excellent man, who not onely hath ſearcht out the whole nature of the thing which he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to define, but even is not ignorant of all other things (if they ought to be limitated right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) about it: Otherwiſe it is eaſie to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and to confound. Now an errour, though ſmall in the defining, becomes great in a ſhort time, &amp;c.</q> Yet how this great and difficult buſineſſe (of defining things accurately) may be a little eaſed, we will adde an obſervation or two. Firſt, let it be held firme and ſure, that the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſts of the next Genus, and the ſpecificall difference. Secondly, that as I doe not deny that that is the beſt definition, which expreſſeth the Genus, and the difference in ſingle words: As this is: Flame is burning ſmoake.) So I doe not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly determine that the Plurality of words is to be avoyded, as often as the evidence and full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſence may be better provided for. And therefore thoſe of ours, ſet downe a little before, are more full of words. Thirdly, that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as often as it cannot be had from the forme (for that theſe are ſometimes unknowne, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:169741:72"/> in naturall things, we confeſſe as well as others) it is to be taken from the end: As BELLARI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUS gathers out of ARISTOTLE himſelfe, and ſhewes in the example of an Horſe (<hi>Praxi Art. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Diſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Num.</hi> 5.) Whoſe end ſeeing 'tis found out to be by the effects and uſe, that he may ſerve man in carrying him, or his things from place to place, ſpeedily and handſomely: He caſts away theſe two, that he may difference him from other living creatures, which afford the like uſe: For both the Oxe and the Aſſe carry, but not ſpeedily; and alſo the Camel, but not ſo handſomely:) He makes from thence ſuch a definition as this. A Horſe is a living creature, ordained to carry a man from place to place ſpeedily and handſomely. Fourthly, yet there ſeemes ſometime to the formall difference there may be added the finall or efficient next to the thing, becauſe that the Eſſence of the thing may be more fully expreſſed, and that (in the following Idea) it may reſolve it ſelfe more eaſily into its Principles. For this end we in the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sunne and Magiſtracy, have added the finall; and in the definition of a ſhaddow the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: In the definition likewiſe of a Horologe, we have ſet downe the difference taken from the end, and from the efficient. Which if it doe not pleaſe, they ſhall be elaborated more accurately, that they may be altogether ſtrict. But I tell you before, we ſhall become obſcure, if we will be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Now the Idea's of things are threefold: Artificiall, Naturall, Divine. The Artificiall are a certaine Ectype, or imitations of things Naturall: the Naturall of Divine, the Divine are from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the true archetype of all things which are rightly done. Which yet in as much as they are hidden in eternity, nor appeare to us but as they are expreſſed in naturall things: Naturall things are to be ſearch'd out by us as much as may be, as well for their owne ſake, that we may underſtand the Artifice of Nature, as for the following Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialls ſake, that we have the intelligence of their foundations: and laſtly for precedent divine things ſake, that we may penetrate alſo more ſafely into thoſe hidden things, as far as the way of divine things permits.</p>
                  <p n="53">LIII. Now all naturall things are made after the ſame Idea's, becauſe by the ſame Maker. Who becauſe he is one, hath kept one order in all things; and becauſe he is the beſt, the beſt; and becauſe true, truly, and not imaginarily. Truly therefore ſeeing that there is order in things, it may be truly found out, if it be ſought in true wayes. Now the wayes are true, not which our underſtanding
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:169741:73"/> (which is too voluble and prone to errours) faignes to it ſelfe, and falſely attributes to things, but which things themſelves do ſhew in their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. For from actions and paſſions come the qualities of things to be knowne, and from the qualities the eſſence, now from all theſe the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall requiſites. Theſe wayes of things if we ſhall follow, and obſerve the indelible characters im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in things, we ſhall finde a wonderfull har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of things; after a certaine ſimilitude of the firſt Being. For we ſhall diſcerne that all things are found in the loweſt Being which are in the higheſt: but in the loweſt degree, ſuch as uſeth to be in the rudiments of things covertly: ſo as the more ſpeciall, and alwaies perfecter diducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of creatures, may be nothing but a greater and perfecter explication <hi>ad extra,</hi> or outwardly of thoſe things which are within: which our Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſick ſhall openly doe. Therefore all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, even to the ſmalleſt duſt or powders are here our Maſters and teachers, if any things be made from them, and of them, let us regard and marke not with brutiſh eyes, but reaſonable and attentive conſideration.</p>
                  <p n="54">LIV. For example ſake that the Idea's of things may be perfectly found out, I thinke we muſt proceed thus: 1. What ever requiſites true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſſentiall are to be met with in all the ſpecies of any thing, there generall Idea is to be put under
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:169741:74"/> the very Genus of the ſame ſpecies. For example ſake; becauſe in every particular motion I ſee three <hi>termini,</hi> From whence, which way, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Why may I not determine that theſe are the generall requiſites of all motion? And why may I not ſeeke theſe ſame things in every Beeing? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely every Beeing is from ſome thing; that is, hath ſome Originall. And proceeds from ſome way, that is, hath ſome forme, by which it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed ſome whither, that is, to its end.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What ever things are found requiſite in the generall Idea of things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſame are to be ſought in every ſpecies put under that Genus. For either all the ſame things will be found out (though under another, that is, a ſpeciall forme and name: As the journy of Chriſt, Mark. 7.31. is deſcribed by theſe three, from Tyre, into Galilee, through De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capolis:) Or it will be an argument that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Idea is not exactly made; which will give an occaſion to mend it: Or laſtly, it will be plaine and evident it is no true ſpecies of that Genus, which will ſerve to rectifie the Partition.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What things ſoever are in one ſpecies, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Analogous, or like and anſwerable in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient proportion, to them may be ſought out in the ſpecies which is oppoſite. For it is in it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, although in ſome different manner, which that difference infers, which makes that new ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. So while I examine what things are required to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:169741:74"/> the manner of foure-footed creatures, and ſearch out ſomewhat analogous in the motion of things which creepe, which flie, which ſwim. I muſt needs finde out moſt profitable matters, and ſuch as are truely in things.</p>
                  <p n="55">LV. As for Axiomes, becauſe none of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned are ignorant, that the maine ſtrength of truth conſiſts in them; none alſo will deny that exquiſite paines ſhould be beſtowed on them in making them every way right, that is, in collecting, orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and making them firme and ſure, even to an unmoved ſtrength. For they are indeed, as they are tearmed, the rules of reaſoning, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of all concluſions collected, and to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by true reaſoning. Whereof there is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number, and more proper order, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller force, both to inquire and finde out the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquered truth of things, and alſo to free and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it from errour, then yet men commonly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. Whereas therefore hitherto they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther collected, nor brought into order, they ſhine forth onely here and there from the thoughts, Doctrines, Diſcourſes, and Actions of men: Nor doe men ſufficiently know how to inſiſt or ſettle on them; and therefore they ſuffer themſelves to be carryed away with every winde of opinions and ſophiſmes, or crafty and deceitfull cavills: And in the meane time there lies hid in them eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially both the ſecrets of the univerſall wiſdome of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:169741:75"/> God, and alſo the ſparks and fuell of our univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall light; and laſtly, the conditions and bonds of procuring univerſall concord and peace amongſt all men, and all things: It will quit for coſt to draw theſe out forcibly even with great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate labour, and ſet them in their right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they may be in readineſſe for any uſe.</p>
                  <p n="56">LVI. But we muſt have a mighty care, leſt that be admitted for an Axiome, which is none: To wit, Propoſitions in part onely, not wholly, not every where, not alwayes, not by themſelves, not reciprocally true. Of which kinde are not onely ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

And to what end is a Rule, which needs another rule? And of which we muſt alwayes be afraid leſt it deceive us? PANSOPHY therefore contains Ax<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="57">LVII. But whence are ſuch Axiomes to be taken? For we have ſayd that vulgar bookes are not to be truſted, nor hath any one as yet taken meet and due paines in collecting them, and cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:169741:75"/> them from their mixed filth. Excepting the renowned, and brave ſpirited HEROE in ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and taming the Monſters of Opinions, B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="58">LVIII. Now Axiomes are beſt collected out of things themſelves, by true, unerring, humane reaſoning, but rather by divine, as we have them expreſſed in the word of God. For what ever any one thinkes, ſpeakes, writes, argues, proves, or diſproves, accuſeth or excuſeth, perſwadeth or diſſwadeth, exhorts or heartily deſires, promiſeth or threatneth, &amp;c. He alwayes and every where meets with certaine preſuppoſed things, on which as on a Baſis his very reaſoning relies. For juſt as whatſoever is moved, is moved about ſomething unmoveable; ſo whatſoever is inferred by reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is inferred by the force of ſome unmoved truth; which may appeare by examples. If any one offer to beat his ſervant with a Cudgell for harme done, and he cries out, I did it not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Loe here is reaſoning on either ſide from things preſuppoſed! For the Maſter preſuppoſes
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169741:76"/> the Axiome: He that doth harme is lyable to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: Thou haſt done harme: Therefore. The ſervant on the contrary: The innocent is not lyable to puniſhment. I am innocent. Therefore. And he ſilently laies downe another thing to his Major as knowne, to wit, this. An offence is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary. My fact is not voluntary. Therefore it is not an offence, &amp;c. Behold ſuch things occur, in the ſayings and doings of all men, even the moſt fooliſh, as remaining footſteps of wiſdome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together with man, and indelible (though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly ſtained with the dirt of folly) markes and characters thereof; that it appeares to be true, which JESUS the ſonne of SIRACH ſayd; That wiſdome hath layd everlaſting foundations in men (Eccleſ. 1.14.) Such common notions therefore may be gathered out of the ſpeeches and actions of all men, even the moſt ſimple and fooliſh: So they be prudently ſeperated from the mingled filth and foyle of fopperies. Whereon to beſtow ones paines and diligence, would be more better then to pick gold out of a dunghill.</p>
                  <p n="59">LIX. But to gather Axiomes out of divine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, that's in truth to gather Pearles from among Gold: For there lies hid the moſt precious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of true wiſdome. For example ſake, when I read, Exod. 22.1. That God commands that the thiefe reſtore that which he hath ſtolne, I gather this Axiome: That which is unjuſtly taken away
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:169741:76"/> is to be reſtored. Alſo that which is reſtored, is to be reſtored to him from whom it was taken away. Now becauſe God for one Oxe, commands five Oxen to be reſtored, and for one Sheepe foure, I make an Axiome: He who dare doe more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, is the more to be puniſhed. (For an Oxe is more then a ſheep: therefore he who offers to do a greater harme to his neighbour, may ſmart the more for his iniquity.) Againe, becauſe it is ſaid in the ſame place, at the fourth verſe. If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, he ſhall reſtore double; from thence I collect an Axiome: An offence newly committed is to be puniſhed more lightly, an old one more ſeverely. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, (for nothing hinders us from adding alſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of reaſon to divine deeds and ſpeeches, ſeeing God is the reaſon of reaſons, and reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies lyes under his ſpeeches and actions, although he do not clearly and plainly expreſſe this every where) becauſe firſt motions are not alwayes in our power, any thing may be admitted unawares, or through incogitancy, but he who offends long, offends the more, having ſpaces to deliberate and recollect himſelfe, yet not repenting. I read in the ſame place at the third verſe: If he have nothing, then he ſhall be ſold for his theft: from thence I eaſily collect that that of the Law who hath not money in his purſe, let him ſuffer in his perſon, hath the force of divine Law. Whereas I read in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169741:77"/> the ſame place, verſe 2.3. that the thiefe might be killed in the night without danger of puniſhment, but not ſo in the day time: becauſe he may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and brought to judgement, or be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knowne and accuſed; from thence iſſue Axiomes.</p>

Therefore let the holy Scripture be read orderly, accurately, and diligently, the reaſon of all Gods ſayings and doings being conſidered as they are ſuch (which truly is every where, by ſo much the more pure and ſolid, by how much the wiſdome of God is greater than that of men) ſuch kind of rules for things, and conceipts may be drawne out, or principles of reaſoning with thoſe very places of Scriptures (in the place of examples) ſet under a little after; that the book of PANSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHY may be truly a Key both for things and the holy Scripture. Furthermore other wiſely-writ books ſhall afford the ſame uſe; that whatſoever may be obſerved to be ſpoken and done pithily and accutely, may be brought into an Axiome.</p>
                  <p n="61">LXI. The ſecond field of hunting Axiomes (though perhaps the former in order) are things themſelves, and their proceeding rationably look'd
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:169741:77"/> on, if we attend in what admirable order, and by what force this or that is done. For whatſoever is done in any particulars, it is certaine that ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall power or force and forme, and end dothly under them all: for Example ſake, That we ſee in living creatures a deſire to preſerve themſelves, and that by an appetite to like things, and avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of contraries, the uſe of nouriſhments for their propogation ſake, &amp;c. doth appeare: wee muſt think all thoſe things come from ſome ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour power, which is alſo in inferiour creatures, though in a lower degree, and though it put forth it ſelfe more obſcurely. From thence then I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſupreame Metaphyſicall Axiom: whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is, delighteth to be: or, whatſoever is, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines it ſelfe in its being, as long as it can. And by this way from all particular (Naturall, Artificiall, Morall, Politicall, Theologicall, ſo that they be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly true) Axiomes, wee may draw out univerſall Metaphyſicks: to which as to common rules all things may ſquare and agree which are made or done, whereſoever they are made or done.</p>
                  <p n="62">LXII. And contrariwiſe, ſome particular A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiomes (about matters Naturall, Artificiall, Morall, and Spirituall) may bee found out of generall Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſicks: if you reduce that particular Theme to its tranſcendent <hi>Genus,</hi> and view its generall Axiomes of ſubſtance, Accident, Quality, &amp;c and apply them to a ſpecialty, or particular. And thus
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:169741:78"/> we have indeed theſe and the other gallant things, which perchance without this guidance of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, had not come to our mind.</p>
                  <p n="63">LXIII. If we goe on diligently in this three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold way, we need not doubt of having a great Harveſt of Axiomes, to wit, a very ample furniture and proviſion of ſolid wiſdome: which if they bee compriſed ſententiouſly in choice words, even as Definitions and Ideas, and diſpoſed in due order according to the Analyſis of things, we ſhall have that we ſeeke after. For it will come to paſſe, by Gods helpe, that all things may be taught quickly, plainly fundamentally. Becauſe Definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s through their ſhortneſſe, will notably helpe the memory, and Ideas, the manner of their eſſence being explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Underſtanding, and Axiomes by their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity will ſerve ſpecially for Certainty and Uſe. For truly by analyſing and defining things, we may ſoone paſſe over the whole Univerſe, by bowelling the Ideas of things, we may behold the inwards of things; by underſtanding Axiomes well, wee may be aſſured of knowledge. Thus all things ſhall bee learned in one perpetuall Method, all tautologies ſhall be eſchewed, cauſes of diſagreeing ſhall bee cut off, the judgement of every one who paſſeth through theſe things ſhall bee ſharpned, to obſerve one thing out of another moſt gallantly: and that which is the maine and greateſt thing, the Art of convincing ſhall be had in readineſſe.</p>

                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:169741:78"/>LXIV. By the art of convincing, I meane a plaine proving or demonſtrative method: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by every thing which is true may be preſented with ſuch evidence to every mans underſtanding, as none of a ſound minde may deny aſſent; or if he deny, it may be wreſted from him though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing and reluctant by the very force of invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or unmaſtred truth. As Mathematicians know how to demonſtrate their owne things; ſo even we wiſh and labour that the like knowledge may be extended to all things. The manner of which thing if it ſhall be found infallible, that may deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly come to be numbred amongſt the chiefe gifts of God, and the principall benefits of PANSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHY. For now all may be taught the truth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught errours, with that cleareneſſe and certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as not any one may not underſtand, not any one draw ought ſo demonſtrated into doubt, the truth of things powerfully printing it ſelfe upon the ſenſes even by its owne light.</p>

The minor is in like manner certain: becauſe if any thing hath not cauſes, actions, paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, true proprieties, that is not at all truly, that is, is not true. Therefore whatſoever is true, muſt needs have true cauſes, and proprieties and effects, whether they be knowne to us already, or not as yet. According to this reaſon onely that which is falſe is indemonſtrable. For as much as it is not
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169741:80"/> truly that which it is ſayd or thought to be, neither hath it true cauſes, proprieties, effects, by which it may be demonſtrated.

So as there's none (I ſpeake of men, not of carkaſſes of men) who joyes not dayly to heare, ſee, taſt, handle, and aſſuredly know ſome new thing.

                  <p>Axiom 2. He who deſires to know, deſires to know truth.</p>
                  <p>For Knowledge unleſſe it be true, is not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but ignorance and errour: which none can wiſh or deſire. For to what end would one erre, that is, be deceived? yea the mind rather abhors it naturally, and therefore if it perceive that it hath erred any where, or think it hath found out an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, it changeth its opinion forthwith either o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly or ſecretly. For cauſes may fall out why ſome one will not ſeem to think otherwiſe, but his errour being taken notice of by him, he cannot think otherwiſe.</p>

This alſo is proper to love, not to let go the thing loved Hence it is that men in their opinions (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be true or falſe, ſobeit they be but daubed or waſh'd over with the paint of truth) perſiſt ſo ſtiffly, that they had even rather dye, then throw away their opinions, which they have drunke-in in the name of truth.</p>
                  <p>Axiom 6. He that holds the truth, wiſhes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to hold the ſame. This alſo is moſt naturall, and inſeperable from the minde of man, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he thinkes that he perceives truely, to wiſh that others may perceive the ſame, and may have as it were his owne minde, accounting it a wrong to him, if any will thinke othewiſe: and by hat act as it were ſilently upbraid him with errour. Hence ariſeth amongſt thoſe that diſagree in opinions (and eſpecially about faith) that diſpleaſure and

                  <p>Axiome 8. He that promotes to truth, promotes by teaching.</p>
                  <p>For other meanes of propogating knowledges, beſides teaching, are ſpurious, and unprofitable to that intention; as if any one perſwade, command, enjoyne, compell to believe or thinke this or that, ſo or ſo. For to underſtand, or believe the truth, is to know: And to know is not a worke of the will, which that it may will any thing is wont to be bent with perſwaſions, commands, threatnings, conſtraint: But the worke of the underſtanding, which of its own nature is nothing but a Looking-glaſſe of things, receiving into it ſelfe whatſoever

                  <p>Axiom 9. But many commonly teach and do not promote thoſe they teach to what they deſire. For the world is full of bookes and pens, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſome ſtrive earneſtly to perſwade others to be of their opinions; but with what profit? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly little, and unbeſeeming ſo great contentions. For amongſt ſo many Troopes of Encounterers, if happily ſome one be converted, an hundred o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers remaine ſettled in their place, nor ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be removed from their opinion. And thoſe who are removed are carryed away as eaſily from the right path, into one that's erroneous, or from one errour into another, and from errour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to truth. And that which is worſe, Controverſies are not onely not taken away, but multiplyed: And leaſt they ſhould be taken away, they are fixed in mens mindes, being hardned againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <p n="76">LXXVI. For if ſuch a Ladder had been made, every mans minde would aſcend to every top of things: which comes now to be ſhewn by a Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſome certain Axioms.</p>

                     <item>1. Every man hath a mind or reaſon For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mind he would not be a man, but a Bruit.</item>
                     <item>2. He who hath a minde, he thinks. For as it is the part of the eye to ſee, of the eare to heare, of the tongue to taſt, of a nerve to touch; ſo it's
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:169741:86"/> proper and eſſentiall to the mind to think.</item>
                     <item>3. He who thinkes, he paſſes from thing to thing. For every thought is a certaine motion of the minde, by which we paſſe over from one thing to another, and from that againe to ſome other. Whence alſo it is called the diſcourſe of the minde. For as the eye, when it hath many things to ſee, it cannot ſee thoſe many things juſt at once, but one thing after another: So the minde whatſoever it thinkes, it thinkes ſomething, of ſome thing, by ſomething, one thing after another.</item>
                     <item>4. He who paſſeth from thing to thing, paſſeth ſtep by ſtep. For mens thoughts hold toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a chaine, in which linke lets in linke. Yea, even when ſomething comes into the minde upon a ſuddaine, being moſt remote from the former thought, yet it comes from ſome occaſion; whether it come from within from ſomething thought, or from without, from ſome ſenſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Uerily as there is no vacuum or gap in things, ſo neither in the underſtanding: And as one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go on with his feet but from the neareſt (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pace, or ſtaire or ſtep) to the next; ſo by thought to come to any thing, unleſſe it be from ſomething, is impoſſible.</item>
                     <item>5. He who goes by ſteps, may go as far as the ſteps go. Therefore every man may aſcend by the minde, as far as he ſees the ſteps or ſtaires of things before him. Which was to be demonſtrated.</item>

This mentall Ladder, becauſe it ſhall onely be an image or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of the Ladder of things, made by divine artifice, it will not lie under our arbitrement or pleaſure. The very things here ſhall give the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure both to themſelves and to the underſtanding. They erre dangerouſly, who thinke it may ſuffice that things be conſidered as they are to us, not of what kinde they are in themſelves: Making our ſenſes a rule to things, not things to the ſenſes. We muſt do the quite contrary, and things are to be made (in which as in its Palace truth reſides) the rule, both to themſelves and to us, if we will at length ſtruggle out of the tumult and claſhings of opinions unto harmony, that as that knits things among themſelves, ſo it may knit our minde about things. Our ſenſes, the phantaſie, the very minde or reaſon, have nothing which they can bring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to or bring into things. But things by bringing themſelves into the ſenſes, the phantaſie, the mind, forme true images of themſelves, being perceived aright or orderly, but monſtrous ones if amiſſe or
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:169741:87"/> diſorderly. Nothing at all therefore is to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the ſence or the minde by it ſelfe, but they are to be tyed moſt cloſely to things, unleſſe we will be deceived and mockt without end and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p n="78">LXXVIII. That then a Ladder for mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding may be made from the Ladder of things, is evident: Becauſe all things are diſpoſed according to ſteps, as well the Univerſe it ſelfe, as every thing apart. For</p>

We truſt, that ſuch a gradation, as may lead the mind to all things is in PANSOPHY, as well in the whole compriſall of things, as in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing ſeverally, or aſunder. For as touching the whole, PANSOPHY hath a firme and unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Baſis, or a three fold ground-worke and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Neceſſity, Poſſibility, Facility: which are ſolidly layd in the booke of <hi>Praecognita</hi>'s. It hath alſo a ſplendid top as firme, Happineſſe, or the reſt of deſires; which the laſt booke of PANSOPHY ſhall ſhow in the delights of the mind enlightned in it ſelfe; and in the amendment and making bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all humane things, and in the illuſtrious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the glory of God. And it hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a firme medium to joyne the top to the Baſis, and fit to receive ſolid ſteppings: to wit, on Gods part, moſt true Revelation made in works, words, and inward dictates, which are innate Notions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven in the mind of every man; and on our part, Senſe, Reaſon, and Faith, that's to be given to the teſtimonies of God. Of which three-paird ſtaffe or ſhank as it were, reared Parallelly, and every where connexed, that moſt ſolid Ladder of things is made: A five fold parted or broken Ladder, I ſay, ariſing through five divers Lofts or Stories. For the firſt and loweſt Ladder or paire of ſtaires is Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſick, which raiſeth the mind as far as it can through all generalls, known by themſelves. The ſecond in the ſecond Region or Story of naturall
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:169741:88"/> things, diſcovers divine Artifices through all degrees of creatures. The third teacheth how to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the works of man, the ſupreame Creature, and ſheweth how far the force of wit may aſcend about created things. The fourth explains the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of man with God himſelfe his Creator, and thereby the myſteries of Salvation and Perdition. The fifth aſcends from thence to contemplate the very increated God inhabiting his eternity. Where a man can go no higher, but he may go lower, to the right uſe of the Creator, of the Creatures, and of himſelfe, that what life remains to any one, may be paſſed and ſpent in wiſe thoughts and actions, and that hereby at laſt there may be had a ſafe and ſure and ſweet paſſage by the gate of death to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py eternity.</p>
                  <p n="80">LXXX. Theſe things concerning the graduall frame of all PANSOPHY: that it may be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that there is no other foundation of humane wiſdome layd, nor other end propounded, nor any poſſibility of comming to that end by other means, than that we go by here; to wit, whence, whither, and which way. All particular things may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the ſame graduall Series; yea they ought, becauſe they cannot in another, if we will teach eaſily or plainly, and powerfully, that is ſcientifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. Certainly, as he doats, who being ſet in the top of a Tower, would have ſome one fly from the earth to him, or fly over to him from the top of a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:169741:89"/> neighbouring Towre, being not led on by ſteps. So doats he who thruſts his owne ſenſe or meaning upon another, the truth thereof being not ſhewed to him leaſurely and by little and little.</p>
                  <p n="81">LXXXI. The uſe then of this gradual method ſhal be to teach the ignorant eaſily &amp; plainly, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teach thoſe that erre powerfully. That theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſee the light of truth, and delight in it; and that the other cannot but take notice of their errour, and be won to the love of better and truer things. Now we muſt note, that to teach the ignorant, is but ſome one and a ſingle buſineſſe: but to teach thoſe that erre requires double pains. For the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant becauſe they know neither truth nor falſhood, are capable of both, and may be taught onely true things, they need not be untaught falſe things: the other becauſe they are pre-occupated or taken up aforehand with falſe opinions, are firſt to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught their errour, that they may be rendred both deſirous and capable of truth, and then of being taught. Which as we have ſeen already cannot be done without gradation: becauſe as the ignorant cannot be advanced to the top of cleare knowledge without ſteps, by a throw or leap: ſo neither can he that erres be caſt down from the top of his error, through the ſtiffneſſe of his opinions, which where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they once cleave to, they cleave to very cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even to death, unleſſe they be prudently taken out. For the mind of man (by the inſtinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:169741:89"/> beares that reverence to truth, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly adores even the ſhaddow thereof; nor can it endure to be pluck'd from it, unleſſe it be well taught things which are more true. Then that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er things may be taught, there's firſt need of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſtepping back, that is a bringing him off that which is abſurd; that the very opinioniſt may plainly perceive that his opinion is contrary to the principles of knowledge, to Senſe, Reaſon, Faith. And then he ſhall be judged brought off from the top of errour on to the plain, to wit, into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon field of Principles. From whence by better and firmer conſequences he ſhall readily ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be led to the tops of better and firmer opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and ſhall be glad that he is brought thither, where he ſhall finde that he is better then before.</p>
                  <p n="82">LXXXII. We muſt likewiſe obſerve this. That wher between the teacher and the learner (or rather the gain-ſayer) the gap may be made up by ſome one medium, there is no need there of more, and that this demonſtration may be diſpatched by one Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicticall Syllogiſme; as we in the 67. and 68.

And where there is a greater diſtance, it needs more mediums, that there may be knit together by them like a chaine, an Apodicticall Sorites, as we have done in the 71. and 74. and 76. and 78.

Thy foundations have taken up a great deale of roome. Do but accompliſh and make good what thou haſt undertaken: and handle thoſe things which thou haſt deviſed and muſed of with thy ſelfe. (Epiſt. 31.) To whom if I ſhould make reply in the words of LUDOVICUS VIVES: <q rend="margQuotes">Many things cannot be brought forth and poliſht at once: there cannot be any thing long ſought for both found out and trimmed by the ſame par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: neither is the life of man, nor the ſmall and feeble ſtrength of his wit ſufficient for ſo many things.</q> And a little after: I know well that one man (he ſpeaks of ARISTOTLE) could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct and refine all thoſe ſo many, ſo various and ſo difficult things, which he had gotten or dig'd out.

'Tis not for one to doe thoſe things which ſcant an hundred have performed. (<hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de cauſis corrupt. Art.</hi>) I feare that this will not ſatisfie them, who bring things after any ſort promiſed into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a debt. Truly VERULAMIUS is by ſome (who alſo think themſelves able to judge) ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laſht, and ill-ſpoken of becauſe he promiſed a great repairing of Arts, but did not performe it, which yet was not promiſed by himſelfe alone, nor did he ever preſume to do that. For he proteſts ſo often and againe that he affords an inſtrument to reſtore Philoſophy, that Philoſophy it ſelfe reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red could not be afforded by the wit or induſtry of one man or age; but by the joynt and freſh-ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, ſo long as need requires, labour of many. After which manner, we proteſt too ſo often, that any thing abſolute and perfect in that buſineſſe, which we would wiſh to be done, is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of us: but onely an occaſion, and certaine rudiments of ſo great a work: becauſe it is better to give at length a beginning ſuch as it is, to things miſſing and deſired, then to ſee ſomething in an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, and never fall in hand with it. Yet it's appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that the vulgar ranke of men are immitators, and had rather feed upon things made ready, and ſit down and be content with things gotten &amp; procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the preſent, than trace and hunt out both the hidden and yet miſtaken order and truth of things. For it is not enough to ſhew them the way: they
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:169741:93"/> would have a Coach and well-greas'd Axeltrees, and horſes yoakt before it, and a skilfull Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and whatſoever other requiſites, that the journey may be ſpeedy, ſecure, and pleaſant. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee there is a certaine neceſſity put upon us likewiſe, that we do not only give advice in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of PANSOPHY, but that we may performe too indeed even as much as he ſhall give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> who gives all things. At leaſt a further, that is a particular delineation of the whole work, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end: ſuch as already in the firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of this Diatypoſis (under the title of Sceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy or a patterne) we ſeem to have promiſed. I would give it, yea I had given it already, but that ſeverall things hindred me. And truly firſt of all the diſdaine of ſo many Praeludiums, by which we might even ſeeme to have a minde to cheat the world: Therefore both certaine good men, and our very conſcience adviſed us, that we ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do then deliberate about doing the buſineſſe. Then fell out (which gave the ſecond ſtop to theſe ſtudies) the thoughts, Solicitings, and promiſes of that friend of ours (who by a certaine, fervent, and extraordinary deſire of promoting the publick good, every way he can, drew us forth with our endeavours into the publick) touching the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us ſome choyſer wits, and the perſwading them to joynt labours in theſe matters: and alſo adviſings about a meeting ſomewhere, to review
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:169741:93"/> the foundations more fully, and to diſtribute the tasks amongſt us. Some years paſt on in theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations: I, in the meane while applying my ſelf in my place to the duties of my ordinary calling; and while I expect a freedome from theſe, and that promiſed leiſure and co-labourers, doing nothing greatly therein. After followed a voyage under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken out of a deſire to ſee certaine of theſe perſons, and to determine our Counſels, which tooke up a yeare and an halfe to no other benefit ſave that more incitements were added and the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended favour of one MaeCaeNAS. whoſe ſpirit the Lord ſtir'd up to cheriſh theſe ſtudies. On whom relying, while I betake my ſelfe to the place of my reſt, and to my labours, occaſions do happen of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſuming our Philologicall ſtudies long ago inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, (of which buſineſſe I ſhall ſhortly render an account in Publick) wherein I have ſpent almoſt a whole yeare already, nor hath the end appeared as yet. Theſe being finiſhed, at laſt, I think to returne to realls: but now more fearfull then of late, both by reaſon of the greatneſs of the work, which I have learned to value better, and in regard of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Co-labourers of whom I am deſtitute. JULIUS POLLUX did alſo in times paſt excuſe the ſlower elaboration or atchivement of his Onoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall worke by the defect of co-labourers, but ſuch as he himſelfe regarded not to uſe. For thus he writes to the Emperour COMMODUS in the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:169741:94"/> Preface of his ſeventh booke: I could get no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labourer to this worke; for I have none whom I can truſt to indeed, and here my judgement muſt alwayes be aſſiſtant. I would willingly uſe them, if they who are able would be willing to be made uſe of: But they pretend that they are unwi ling to trouble our lines, that the frame is to be finiſhed by us as it was begun, that their induſtry ſhall not be a wanting for the making of it perfect after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Yea one of my chiefe friends writ expreſly of late: As two mothers cannot be delivered at once of one infant; ſo neither can two mindes of one Panharmonicall worke; but mutuall cenſure will refine produced fruits. I confeſſe this is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken not without reaſon: Yet perhaps it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Publick, that the true cauſe which I doe not ſuſpect but know, (one or other already open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledging it thus) be not publickly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. <q rend="margQuotes">It is not thought to be the poynt of a wiſe man to deſert the Haven of his ſure ſtation, and to expoſe himſelfe to the uncertaine ſea and the windes.</q> For theſe ſtudies have found nothing as yet in the Publick, beſide applauſe, which fats no body. I ſay in publick; becauſe we are fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to moſt unhappy times, which buſie and take up Kings and Kingdomes with Warres, and who not? And they thinke the Authority of ſome private MECAENAS though moſt munificent, is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, on whom many as on an unmoved Rock may
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:169741:94"/> reſt. They ſay he is but one man, and mortall, and mutable, and by whom it may be Heroick Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes will be valued, not according to their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, but their event: And who, if the buſineſſe ſhould not ſucceed anſwerably to his hope, or to the deſires of many, might conſtrue himſelfe to be made a laughing-ſtock; and ſuch like things as theſe I heare whiſpered. Therefore theſe things give me an occaſion of advertiſing publickly what the moſt illuſtrious Chancelour of ENGLAND in his time advertiſed his King. For I had rather propound in his words, the things which I now deviſe, and thinke are to be propounded to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation of thoſe who in the place of God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne the affaires of men. Thus then he (in the preface to his ſecond booke of the Augmentations of Sciences:) It ſuites every way with your Majeſty not onely to irradiate (as you doe) your age; but alſo to extend your care to thoſe things which all memory may nouriſh, and which very eternity may behold. Now amongſt theſe things (unleſſe my earneſt deſire towards Learning deceive me) there can be no worthyer or nobler act, then to endow the world with ſolid and fruitfull Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Sciences, &amp;c. Then againe. Let this be layd downe (which any one may grant,) that all the greateſt and moſt difficult workes are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come either by largeneſſe of rewards, or by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and wholeſomeneſſe of counſels, or by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169741:95"/> of labours. The firſt whereof extimulates the endeavour; the ſecond takes away Ambages and Errours; the third helpes humane frailty; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the wiſe man doth adde here: Amongſt theſe three, Prudence and wholeſomeneſſe of counſell obtaines the chiefe praiſe, that is the ſhewing and the delineation of the right and ready way, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the things which is propounded: For a lame man (as we uſe to ſay) in the way out-ſtrips a Runner out of the way. [In which words our delineations of the Panſophicall worke, if they be good, are approved.] Yet a little after he wiſhes joynt labours, and liberall rewards to be appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for them by publick Authority, who are occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed about the univerſall foundations, and very roots of wiſdome, in theſe words. Amongſt ſo many excellently founded Colledges of Europe, I wonder that they ſhould be all deſtinated to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Profeſſions, none of them dedicated to the liberall and univerſall ſtudies of Arts and Sciences. For if any one judge all Learning to be referred to Uſe and Action, he underſtands well: But it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie by this meanes to ſlide into that errour, which the old Fable touches ſharpely: In which the reſt of the Bodies Members accuſed the Belly, that it neither afforded motion as the Limbs, nor ſenſe as the Head; though in the meane time the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle doth conveigh the concocted and digeſted nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment to the other parts of the Body. Juſt in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169741:95"/> the ſame manner he who deemes that a vaine and idle ſtudy which is placed in univerſall contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions doth not perceive that juice &amp; ſtrength is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred from thence to all Profeſſions and Arts. And indeed I am perſwaded, that this hath not been the leaſt cauſe why the happyer Progreſſe of learning is hitherto retarded: For that in theſe fundamentall Sciences pains is taken only <hi>in tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu,</hi> or by the by, nor have men their full and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty draughts from thence. For if you deſire a Tree ſhould prove more fruitfull than ordinary, you vainly thinke of remedying the boughs or bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: The very earth is to be looſed about the root, and better mold to be put to it; or elſe you doe meere nothing, &amp;c. Afterwards it's of prime importance, that ſuch (Searchers-out of things) be choſen from among the beſt and moſt furniſhed perſons: to wit, whoſe labour is not imployed to a tranſitory uſe, but to maintaine the iſſue of knowledge for ages. This cannot be, unleſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and ſuch conditions be appoynted, with which every one that's moſt eminent in that Art may be very well content: that ſo it may not bee grievous to him to dye in the ſame buſineſſe, and that he may not ſo much as thinke on the Practick, &amp;c. Otherwiſe if there bee not very ample and faire rewards ordained and ſettled for the Fathers of Sciences, that will fall out:

                  </p>
                  <p>Some things being mentioned between, he adds: Truly the Munificence and bounty of men is not clean and altogether ceaſed: for we ſee there are not onely Books, (Libraries) but Spheres, Globes, Aſtrolabes, Maps, and ſuch like, &amp;c. provided and afforded as certaine helps to the ſtudy of Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Coſmography. Wee ſee alſo ſome places dedicated to the ſtudy of Phyſick; that they have Gardens for the view and knowledge of Simples of every kinde, nor want they the uſe of dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for Anatomicall obſervations. But theſe things appertaine to few. It may paſſe for truth in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that there can hardly be great progreſſes in getting out the hidden things of nature, unleſſe men may have abundantly wherewithall to beare the charges and coſt they ſhall be at for the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments either of VULCAN or DAEDALUS. And therefore as Princes Secretaries and Spies are ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to give up accounts of their expences for their diligences in exploring and getting out new things and hidden ſecrets: ſo likewiſe ſhould the Scouts and obſervers of nature be ſatisfied concerning their expences. Otherwiſe we ſhall never be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and certified of very many things moſt worthy to bee knowne. For if ALEXANDER
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:169741:96"/> gave ARISTOTLE a great ſum of money, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall he ſhould hire Huntſmen, Fowlers, Fiſhers, and others, that he might come the more furniſhed to write the Hiſtory of living creatures: Surely ſome greater matter is due to thoſe who travell not in the Groves of nature, but in the Labyrinths of Arts, open a way for themſelves and others. Thus far he, whoſe words I commend to their peculiar conſideration whom God hath commanded to be eminent, and to be ſet as it were upon a Watch-towre to looke carefully to the publick good. As for mee, I ſhall willingly doe whatſoever God through my weakneſſe will have done: and as ſoone as I ſhall be permitted to returne to theſe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, I will make ready a Sceleton of all PANSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHY, and expoſe it to publick cenſure. To the end that either that Series may remaine, if better things ſhall not be found out, or to yield occaſion even for an eager ſearch after better things: untill the beſt thing which is the very uncontrouled po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and light of order and truth be found out. At the leaſt wiſe, that theſe things of ours may be a witneſſe that all things ought to be taken for poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and feaſeable. Let me end with the words of the Renowned VERULAM, with which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes his aforeſayd Preface. <q rend="margQuotes">What things ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may be perfected by ſome, though not by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and by many joyntly, though not by one, and in ſucceſſion of ages, though not in the ſame
